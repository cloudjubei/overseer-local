# Multi-Platform Development Workflow and Tooling Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for building, testing, and releasing our application across multiple platforms: Electron (desktop), React (web), and React Native (mobile). The goal is to maximize code reuse, maintain a consistent developer experience, and streamline the release process.

## 1. Monorepo Strategy

We will adopt a monorepo strategy to manage the codebase for all platforms. This approach centralizes all code in a single repository, making it easier to share logic, manage dependencies, and coordinate changes across applications.

-   **Tooling**: We will use a modern monorepo tool like [Nx](https://nx.dev/) or [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo). These tools provide features like dependency graph analysis, smart builds, and distributed caching, which are crucial for managing a large, multi-package repository.
-   **Structure**:
    ```
    /
    ├── apps/
    │   ├── electron-app/
    │   ├── mobile-app/       (React Native)
    │   └── web-app/          (React)
    ├── packages/
    │   ├── shared-logic/     (Business logic, state management)
    │   ├── api-client/       (Backend communication layer)
    │   ├── ui-components/    (Shared React/React Native components)
    │   └── design-tokens/    (Colors, typography, spacing)
    ├── docs/
    ├── scripts/
    └── package.json
    ```

## 2. Shared Development Environment Setup

A consistent development environment is key to minimizing setup friction and "it works on my machine" issues.

-   **Node.js & Package Manager**: We will enforce a specific Node.js version using an `.nvmrc` file. [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) will be our package manager of choice due to its efficiency with monorepos and disk space.
-   **VS Code Extensions**: A list of recommended VS Code extensions will be provided in a `.vscode/extensions.json` file. This will include tools for linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and debugging.
-   **Setup Script**: A root-level `setup.sh` or `setup.js` script will be created to automate the installation of all dependencies and any required Git hooks.

## 3. Cross-Platform Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy will be multi-layered to ensure quality across all platforms.

-   **Unit & Integration Tests**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) will be used for unit and integration testing of shared logic and components. Shared packages (`packages/*`) must have high test coverage.
-   **E2E Testing**:
    -   **Web & Electron**: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) will be used for end-to-end testing of the web and Electron applications.
    -   **Mobile**: [Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/) or [Appium](https://appium.io/) will be used for end-to-end testing on iOS and Android.
-   **Static Analysis**: ESLint and Prettier will be enforced across the entire codebase to maintain code quality and consistency. TypeScript's strict mode will be enabled.

## 4. Code Sharing and Version Management

Maximizing code sharing is a primary goal.

-   **Shared Packages**: Logic that is not platform-specific will reside in `packages/`. This includes business logic, API clients, utility functions, and type definitions.
-   **UI Components**: For UI, we will explore tools like [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) to share components between the mobile and web apps. A separate `ui-components` package will house these components, with platform-specific extensions (`.native.tsx`, `.web.tsx`) where necessary.
-   **Versioning**: Shared packages will be versioned independently using [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Changes to shared packages will trigger new releases of the dependent applications.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline

We will use GitHub Actions for our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

-   **CI Workflow (on Pull Request)**:
    1.  Lint and format check.
    2.  Run unit and integration tests for affected packages/apps (using the monorepo tool's affected command).
    3.  Build all applications.
    4.  Run E2E tests.
-   **CD Workflow (on Merge to `main`)**:
    1.  All CI steps.
    2.  Increment package versions where needed.
    3.  Publish updated shared packages to a private registry (e.g., GitHub Packages).
    4.  Build and deploy applications:
        -   **Web**: Deploy to a hosting provider like Vercel or AWS S3/CloudFront.
        -   **Electron**: Create installers/binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and attach them to a GitHub Release.
        -   **Mobile**: Build and submit to TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Console Internal Testing (Android).

## 6. Local Development with Backend Services

Developers should be able to run the entire stack locally for development and testing.

-   **Backend Environment**: We will use Docker Compose to define and run our backend services locally. A `docker-compose.yml` file will be provided at the root of the repository.
-   **API Client**: The `api-client` package will be configured to point to `http://localhost:<port>` by default in development mode. Environment variables will be used to configure API endpoints for different environments (development, staging, production).
-   **Offline First**: The applications should be designed to be as functional as possible in offline mode. This involves local caching of data and optimistic UI updates.

## 7. Debugging and Profiling

-   **Web**: Chrome DevTools.
-   **Electron**: Chrome DevTools for the renderer process and the Node.js inspector for the main process.
-   **React Native**: [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) or React Native Debugger. We will leverage tools for inspecting network requests, component hierarchy, and state.
-   **Profiling**: React DevTools Profiler and platform-specific tools (Lighthouse for web, Xcode Instruments for iOS, Android Studio Profiler for Android) will be used to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

## 8. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

-   **Component Library**: We will use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to document our shared UI components, making them discoverable and easy to test in isolation.
-   **Architecture Decisions**: Major architectural decisions will be documented using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored in `docs/adr`.
-   **READMEs**: Every package and application will have a `README.md` file explaining its purpose, setup instructions, and usage.
-   **Wiki**: The GitHub Wiki will be used for general project information, onboarding guides, and team processes.

## 9. Team Coordination and Release Management

-   **Branching Strategy**: We will use a simple trunk-based development model. All work is done on short-lived feature branches that are merged directly into `main` after a code review.
-   **Pull Requests**: A PR template will be used to ensure that all changes are well-described and linked to a corresponding issue.
-   **Release Process**:
    -   Releases will be managed using tags in Git.
    -   A `CHANGELOG.md` will be maintained for each application, possibly automated using a tool like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
    -   Releases of the different applications will be coordinated, especially when they depend on the same version of a shared package.
