Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: e334cc68-fb9b-45cf-9440-bb13b39f832d)\n##TITLE:\nSeparate project (local npm module) - SQL database that allows standard operations\n##DESCRIPTION:\nWe need a local sql database so that we can store all the files for this project in there.\n\nFor the time being, we just require one table - entities.\nAn entity will have an id (uuid), type (for now - project_file, internal_document, external_blob), content (optional string), tokenized content, embedding, createdAt, updatedAt, metadata (optional json).\n\nSo from this project, we will have the 2 entity types ready to populate the entities table - project_file (everything under `src/`) and internal_document (everything under `docs/`).\n\nIt must be possible to do hybrid search on the tokenized content and embeddings (with a weight factor giving more prevalence to one of them).\n\nThis project should be placed inside this project under `packages/thefactory-db` and imported into this project as a local npm module (so in `package.json` there must be dependency entry with \"thefactory-db\": \"file:packages/thefactory-db\" ). This new 'thefactory-db' project must be able to compile and produce a build in a similar fashion to this project.\n\nThe new package will produce some local files where the database will be stored - it must be possible to import the same package in a completely different project, provide the right path and thus load the same database. This means that this project should be provided access to this new thefactory-db project via a slim interface, so that we don't run into concurrency issues (and so there's just one running db access point). If the thefactory-db isn't provided - then only the search_files function must resort to the current one (otherwise it should always try the full db hybrid search).\n\nWe need to have a script to run in the console to test some basic db functionality - load it with all the files of this project and run some simple queries.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Project Scaffolding for `thefactory-db` Package (ID: 16e2dc27-40a9-448b-bf83-edfac7e22e22)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create the directory structure and initial configuration for the new local npm package. This includes creating `packages/thefactory-db`, initializing `package.json`, setting up `tsconfig.json` for compilation, and creating a placeholder `src/index.ts`. Finally, add this new package as a local file dependency in the root `package.json`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# Project File and Tooling Organisation\\n\\n## Overview\\n- This repository implements a multi-agent development workflow, with tools for reading/writing files, managing tasks and features, running tests, and exposing these as chat-callable tools.\\n- Source code lives under src/.
