        "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f72dbcdb-77e7-4d00-bf72-e2cc59271644)\n##TITLE:\nMain project structure based on the graphiti library\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThere's a library `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti` that provides an upgraded RAG database - a knowledge graph. This project needs to be able to run locally and must expose an API that any client can interact with.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create API Endpoint to Query the Graph (ID: 593203e1-8117-4149-b0bb-8dc46d618a1a)\n##DESCRIPTION: Implement a GET endpoint (e.g., `/query`) in `main.py`. This endpoint will accept a query string, use the `GraphService` to search the knowledge graph, and return the relevant results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f72dbcdb-77e7-4d00-bf72-e2cc59271644)\n##TITLE:\nMain project structure based on the graphiti library\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThere's a library `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti` that provides an upgraded RAG database - a knowledge graph. This project needs to be able to run locally and must expose an API that any client can interact with.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Add Docker Support for Local Execution (ID: 91be4de2-b9cc-4c0a-bc0f-d0ff07ff0d55)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the FastAPI application. Also, create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the application service, making it easy to build and run the entire project locally with a single command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

        "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f72dbcdb-77e7-4d00-bf72-e2cc59271644)\n##TITLE:\nMain project structure based on the graphiti library\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThere's a library `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti` that provides an upgraded RAG database - a knowledge graph. This project needs to be able to run locally and must expose an API that any client can interact with.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Implement Configuration Management (ID: 9fd9a0a9-3f9e-4699-a9eb-d8f86aa1d713)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create a `config.py` module to manage application settings using environment variables (e.g., via Pydantic's BaseSettings). This will handle configurations like API port, logging levels, and any specific settings for the graphiti library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f72dbcdb-77e7-4d00-bf72-e2cc59271644)\n##TITLE:\nMain project structure based on the graphiti library\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThere's a library `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti` that provides an upgraded RAG database - a knowledge graph. This project needs to be able to run locally and must expose an API that any client can interact with.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Update README with Setup and Usage Instructions (ID: c50d1444-b482-443a-ae5c-ecabb54e9ae9)\n##DESCRIPTION: Flesh out the `README.md` file with a project description, detailed instructions on how to set up the environment (both natively with Poetry and with Docker), how to run the application, and examples of how to use the API endpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

You can provide variables via:\\n- A .env file at project root (loaded automatically by Pydantic if configured), or\\n- Environment variables set in your shell or Docker environment.\\n\\nCommon environment variables\\n- APP_HOST: Host for the API server (default: 0.0.0.0)\\n- APP_PORT: Port for the API server (default: 8000)\\n- LOG_LEVEL: Logging level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG) (default: INFO)\\n- GRAPH_STORAGE_PATH: Filesystem path for Graphiti storage (default: ./.graphiti)\\n- GRAPH_RESET: If true, resets/clears the graph on startup (default: false)\\n- GRAPH_MODEL: Model name used by Graphiti for embedding or related features\\n- GRAPH_COLLECTION: Name of the default collection in the knowledge graph\\n\\nNote: Check src/graphiti_api/config.py for the authoritative list and defaults.\\n\\nAPI Usage\\nHealth check\\n- Method: GET\\n- URL: /health\\n- Description: Returns a simple health status.\\n- Example:\\n  curl -s http://localhost:8000/health\\n\\nIngest documents\\n- Method: POST\\n- URL: /documents\\n- Description: Ingest plain text into the Graphiti knowledge graph. The server will initialize the graph (if not already) and store the ingested content.\\n- Request body (JSON):\\n  {\\n    \\\"text\\\": \\\"Your document text here\\\"\\n  }\\n- Example:\\n  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \\\\\\n       -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n       -d '{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Graphiti is a knowledge graph for RAG.\\\"}'\\n\\n- Expected response: JSON acknowledging ingestion and returning metadata such as an ID or status. Refer to the /docs UI for the exact response schema produced by the current implementation.\\n\\nProject structure\\nSee docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md for details. High-level:\\n- src/graphiti_api/\\n  - main.py: FastAPI app definition and routes\\n  - config.py: Pydantic Settings for configuration\\n  - graph_service.py: Graphiti graph initialization and access\\n- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml: Container setup and orchestration\\n- pyproject.toml: Poetry project configuration\\n\\nDevelopment workflow\\n- Format/lint: Use your preferred tooling (e.g., black, isort, ruff). Add to pyproject.toml as needed.\\n- Run locally: poetry run uvicorn graphiti_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload\\n- Tests: Future features will add a tests/ directory and pytest configuration.\\n\\nDocker notes\\n- The Dockerfile builds a production-style image for the FastAPI app.\\n- docker-compose.yml maps the service to port 8000 by default.\\n- You can pass environment variables via docker-compose.yml or an .env file. If you set GRAPH_RESET=true on startup, the graph storage may be cleared.\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n- Port already in use: Change APP_PORT or stop the conflicting process.\\n- Permission issues with storage path: Ensure GRAPH_STORAGE_PATH is writable by the running user or container user.\\n- Unexpected errors on startup: Run with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG and check stack traces in the console.\\n\\nLicense\\nApache-2.0 (or update as appropriate for your project).\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n- Graphiti by Zep: https://github.com/getzep/graphiti\\n- FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\\n\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"finish_feature\",\"arguments\":{}}]}",
