        "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 9b6fcd9f-86b9-4a95-bf03-e3cf51431be4)\n##TITLE:\nMonitor a task/feature as it's running and update information based off of git commits\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThe status of the tasks isn't updated\nWhen the Agent runs it updates the status in its own local copy.\nThis project's tasks/features statuses should update too.\nAs a later part, we also want to be observing git commits - if there's a commit in the appropriate branch (named after the task) with a given featureId specified, it should be possible to see the task.json inside there and update info HERE in this project based off it.\nAs a further improvement - we can make a 1-click merge solution so that the commit tied to the feature will get merged with the current code base.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create a Git Monitoring Service in the Main Process (ID: 9de723a2-db03-4ff0-aab8-8615b9473664)\n##DESCRIPTION: Implement a service in the Electron main process to periodically monitor the local git repository for changes. This service will be the foundation for tracking task progress. It should be able to fetch updates from remotes and check for new commits on branches. It will be located in a new directory `src/main/services/git-monitor`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",

Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`.

Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output.

        "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 9b6fcd9f-86b9-4a95-bf03-e3cf51431be4)\n##TITLE:\nMonitor a task/feature as it's running and update information based off of git commits\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThe status of the tasks isn't updated\nWhen the Agent runs it updates the status in its own local copy.\nThis project's tasks/features statuses should update too.\nAs a later part, we also want to be observing git commits - if there's a commit in the appropriate branch (named after the task) with a given featureId specified, it should be possible to see the task.json inside there and update info HERE in this project based off it.\nAs a further improvement - we can make a 1-click merge solution so that the commit tied to the feature will get merged with the current code base.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Implement Logic to Update Local Task State from Commit Data (ID: 7b9c8ad9-05ec-4281-bbc4-11354a121ecb)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create a function that takes the data extracted from a commit's `task.json` and updates the corresponding local `tasks/<taskId>/task.json` file. The update should focus on syncing feature statuses and any other relevant metadata from the agent's work-in-progress commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\n  - main/services/git-monitor/: Main-process Git monitoring service that fetches remotes and tracks branch head changes; includes CommitAnalyzer to parse task.json from commits.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",

Service\\\\n\\\\nThis service watches Git repositories for new commits and branch head changes to keep the app in sync with active tasks and features.\\\\n\\\\n## Branch naming helper\\\\n\\\\nThis folder contains `branchNaming.js`, a small utility that defines the task-to-branch naming convention used by the monitor:\\\\n\\\\n- Convention: `features/<taskId>`\\\\n- Exposed helpers:\\\\n  - `toBranchName(taskId)` -> `features/<taskId>`\\\\n  - `isFeatureBranch(branchName)` -> boolean\\\\n  - `parseTaskIdFromBranch(branchName)` -> `<taskId> | null`\\\\n\\\\nUse these helpers anywhere you need to map between tasks and their corresponding Git branches.\\\\n\\\\n## Commit Analyzer\\\\n\\\\n`CommitAnalyzer.js` can inspect a specific commit SHA or ref to locate `tasks/<taskId>/task.json` without checking out the branch. It uses `git ls-tree` and `git show` to:\\\\n\\\\n- List candidate task.json files within the commit tree.\\\\n- Read and parse each `task.json`.\\\\n- Return a structured result that includes the raw file, parsed task object, and a compact summary (task id, status, features list with statuses).\\\\n\\\\nExample (main process):\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport { CommitAnalyzer } from './CommitAnalyzer';\\\\n\\\\nconst analyzer = new CommitAnalyzer({ repoPath: '/path/to/repo' });\\\\nconst report = await analyzer.analyze('features/1234'); // or a commit SHA\\\\nif (report.found) {\\\\n  for (const f of report.files) {\\\\n    if (f.parseOk) {\\\\n      console.log('Task summary:', f.summary);\\\\n    }\\\\n

        "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 9b6fcd9f-86b9-4a95-bf03-e3cf51431be4)\n##TITLE:\nMonitor a task/feature as it's running and update information based off of git commits\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThe status of the tasks isn't updated\nWhen the Agent runs it updates the status in its own local copy.\nThis project's tasks/features statuses should update too.\nAs a later part, we also want to be observing git commits - if there's a commit in the appropriate branch (named after the task) with a given featureId specified, it should be possible to see the task.json inside there and update info HERE in this project based off it.\nAs a further improvement - we can make a 1-click merge solution so that the commit tied to the feature will get merged with the current code base.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Expose Git Operations via IPC for UI Interaction (ID: 7a81601a-c0dc-418f-a0f3-a83e8a19919d)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create an IPC channel in the Electron main process to handle git-related requests from the renderer process. This will include an action to trigger the merge of a task branch. The handler in the main process will execute the necessary git commands safely and provide feedback (success or failure) to the UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\n  - main/services/git-monitor/: Main-process Git monitoring service that fetches remotes and tracks branch head changes; includes CommitAnalyzer to parse task.json from commits.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",

        "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 9b6fcd9f-86b9-4a95-bf03-e3cf51431be4)\n##TITLE:\nMonitor a task/feature as it's running and update information based off of git commits\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThe status of the tasks isn't updated\nWhen the Agent runs it updates the status in its own local copy.\nThis project's tasks/features statuses should update too.\nAs a later part, we also want to be observing git commits - if there's a commit in the appropriate branch (named after the task) with a given featureId specified, it should be possible to see the task.json inside there and update info HERE in this project based off it.\nAs a further improvement - we can make a 1-click merge solution so that the commit tied to the feature will get merged with the current code base.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Add 'Merge' Button to Task UI for Completed Features (ID: f75ee4d1-8928-4634-bb6d-56b2f2f63ad2)\n##DESCRIPTION: In the renderer process, add a 'Merge' button to the task view. This button will be enabled when the Git Monitoring Service detects that a task branch has unmerged commits. Clicking the button will trigger an IPC call to the main process to execute a git merge of the task branch into the current main development branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\n  - main/services/git-monitor/: Main-process Git monitoring service that fetches remotes and tracks branch head changes; includes CommitAnalyzer to parse task.json from commits.\\n  - main/services/git-ops/: Main-process Git operations IPC (merge task branches, list feature branches) for UI-triggered actions.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",
