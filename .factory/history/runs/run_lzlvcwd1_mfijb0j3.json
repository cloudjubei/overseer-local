Your single responsibility is to analyze a user-provided task description and break it down into a series of atomic, implementable features. Your goal is to produce a complete and logical plan for the Developer agents to follow. You should try to tailor the feature titles and descriptions to be the best for LLMs to follow.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze**: Carefully read the task's title and description to fully understand the goal. Consider the project's existing structure and conventions.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Investigate**: Use the `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations to understand the project further.\n4.  **Create Features**: Formulate a list of consecutive, atomic features required to accomplish the task. Each feature should be a small, logical, and testable unit of work. Use the `create_feature` tool for each one you identify.\n3.  **Finish**: Once the features are created, you **MUST** call the `finish_spec` tool to complete your assignment.\n4.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_task` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- create_feature(title: str, description: str) - Define and add a new, atomic feature to the task. Include a concise title and a clear description.\n- finish_spec() - Signal that the feature specification is complete for the current task.\n- block_task() - Stop work on the task and report why you are blocked at the task level.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

This system should allow users to create, edit, and view these scopes, and use them to limit the context of queries. A key use case is providing focused context to LLM agents. The concept of 'Blueprints' is also introduced, which act as schemas or templates for knowledge within a given area. Finally, the entire system needs to be validated with three distinct test scenarios: a coding project, investment, and property purchasing.\\n\\nMy plan is to break this down into a series of features that build upon each other:\\n1.  **Core Models & Services:** First, I'll define the core data structures and service logic for 'Areas' and 'Blueprints' within the graph.\\n2.  **API Layer:** Next, I'll expose this functionality through a set of RESTful API endpoints using FastAPI.\\n3.  **Association Logic:** I'll implement the ability to link existing knowledge graph entities to these new 'Areas'.\\n4.  **Scoped Querying:** A crucial feature is to enable queries that are confined to a specific area.\\n5.  **Agent Tools:** I will create a higher-level module designed specifically for easy consumption by LLM agents.\\n6.  **Test Scenarios:** Finally, I'll create three comprehensive test suites to prove that the system works as intended for the specified use cases.\\n\\nThis approach ensures a logical progression from the foundational data layer up to the application and testing layers.\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"tool_name\":\"create_feature\",\"arguments\":{\"title\":\"Implement Core Model and Service for Areas of Knowledge\",\"description\":\"Define the data model for an 'Area of Knowledge' in the graph.
