    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: when searching commands in the command lookup it must be possible to use arrows to go up/down and select the appropriate command (ID: 75e8b34f-8e44-4bac-9c9a-26c0dfb17224)\n##DESCRIPTION: @src/renderer/components/ui/CommandMenu.tsx\n\nThe input box should be a single line input - so the user cannot go up and down in there. Using up and down arrows selects different items in the results list.\n\n##REJECTION REASON:\nThis doesn't work\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems.

    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: After closing the app and coming back none of the agent run histories show messages properly (ID: e3d6999d-3dcd-4f28-8452-77daa5b9cab2)\n##DESCRIPTION: It seems there's an issue with the way the messages are serialized in @packages/factory-ts/src/orchestrator.ts , the display is in @src/renderer/components/agents/ChatConversation.tsx\n\n##REJECTION REASON:\nThese now show, but the fix was to reformat the messages on read. They should simply be recorded correctly in the right format in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\",\"packages/factory-ts/src/orchestrator.ts\":\"import fs from 'node:fs';\\nimport fsp from 'node:fs/promises';\\nimport path from 'node:path';\\nimport os from 'node:os';\\nimport { AgentResponse, CompletionClient, CompletionMessage, Feature, Task, ToolCall, ToolResult } from './types.js';\\nimport type { TaskUtils } from './taskUtils.js';\\nimport type { FileTools } from './fileTools.js';\\nimport type { GitManager } from './gitManager.js';\\nimport { logger, logLLMStep } from './logger.js';\\n\\nconst MAX_TURNS_PER_FEATURE = 100;\\n\\n// Prefer process.cwd(), but do not assume it points to a real filesystem root when packaged (asar)\\nconst FRAMEWORK_ROOT = path.resolve(process.cwd());\\nconst NEWLINE = '\\\\n';\\n\\nfunction loadAgentDocs(agent: string): string {\\n  // Mirror Python: docs live under packages/factory-ts/docs\\n  const p = path.join(FRAMEWORK_ROOT, 'packages', 'factory-ts', 'docs', `AGENT_${agent.toUpperCase()}.md`);\\n  return fs.readFileSync(p, 'utf8');\\n}\\n\\nfunction loadProtocolExample(): string {\\n  try {\\n    const p = path.join(FRAMEWORK_ROOT, 'packages', 'factory-ts', 'docs', 'agent_response_example.json');\\n    const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p, 'utf8'));\\n    return JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);\\n  } catch (e) {\\n    return '{\\\\n\\\"thoughts\\\":\\\"Your reasoning here...\\\",\\\\n\\\"tool_calls\\\":[ ... ]\\\\n}';\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconst PROTOCOL_INSTRUCTIONS = (() => {\\n  const example = loadProtocolExample();\\n  return [\\n    'You **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object.

    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: when a notification is read - don't show the count in the sidebar (ID: 7b2917b5-67da-437e-b11e-f11989bbae7e)\n##DESCRIPTION: Also, show a nice round badge with the number inside - similar in style to iOS notifications.\nThis is in @src/renderer/navigation/SidebarView.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\",\"src/renderer/navigation/SidebarView.tsx\":\"import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react';\\nimport TasksView from '../screens/TasksView';\\nimport FilesView from '../screens/FilesView';\\nimport SettingsView from '../screens/SettingsView';\\nimport ChatView from '../screens/ChatView';\\nimport NotificationsView from '../screens/NotificationsView';\\nimport AgentsView from '../screens/AgentsView';\\nimport AllAgentsView from '../screens/AllAgentsView';\\nimport { useNavigator } from './Navigator';\\nimport Tooltip from '../components/ui/Tooltip';\\nimport { useNotifications } from '../hooks/useNotifications';\\n// import { useShortcuts } from '../hooks/useShortcuts';\\nimport { MAIN_PROJECT, useProjectContext } from '../projects/ProjectContext';\\nimport type { NavigationView } from '../types';\\nimport { useAppSettings } from '../hooks/useAppSettings';\\nimport { useAgents } from '../hooks/useAgents';\\nimport NotificationBadge from '../components/tasks/NotificationBadge';\\nimport { ProjectSpec } from 'packages/factory-ts/src/types';\\n\\nexport type SidebarProps = {};\\n\\nfunction classNames(...xs: Array<string | false | null | undefined>) {\\n  return xs.filter(Boolean).join(' ')\\n}\\n\\ntype NavDef = {\\n  id: string;\\n  label: string;\\n  view: NavigationView;\\n  icon: React.ReactNode;\\n  accent?: 'brand' | 'purple' | 'teal' | 'gray';\\n};\\n\\nconst NAV_ITEMS: NavDef[] = [\\n  { id: 'home', label: 'Home', view: 'Home', icon: <span aria-hidden>🏠</span>, accent: 'brand' },\\n  { id: 'files', label: 'Files', view: 'Files', icon: <span aria-hidden>📚</span>, accent: 'purple' },\\n  { id: 'chat', label: 'Chat', view: 'Chat', icon: <span aria-hidden>💬</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\n  { id: 'agents', label: 'Agents', view: 'Agents', icon: <span aria-hidden>🤖</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\n  { id: 'notifications', label: 'Notifications', view: 'Notifications', icon: <span aria-hidden>🔔</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\n  { id: 'settings', label: 'Settings', view: 'Settings', icon: <span aria-hidden>⚙️</span>, accent: 'gray' },\\n  { id: 'all-agents', label: 'All Agents', view: 'AllAgents', icon: <span aria-hidden>🗂️</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\n];\\n\\nfunction useMediaQuery(query: string) {\\n  const [matches, setMatches] = useState<boolean>(() => typeof window !== 'undefined' ?

    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Notifications should fire when an agent finishes work (ID: df22d856-9aa3-4c10-9e91-04291697e0b8)\n##DESCRIPTION: Also when a feature is completed (i.e. a commit is made).\nThe @src/renderer/services/notificationsService.ts is responsible as well @src/notifications/manager.js    \n\nThese should be toggle'able in @src/renderer/screens/SettingsView.tsx\n\n##REJECTION REASON:\nThe agent run doesn't have a featureId - the information about a feature being completed is inside the messagesLog\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\",\"src/renderer/screens/SettingsView.tsx\":\"import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\\nimport { Button } from '../components/ui/Button';\\nimport { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '../components/ui/Select';\\nimport { Switch } from '../components/ui/Switch';\\nimport { useLLMConfig } from '../hooks/useLLMConfig';\\nimport { useTheme, type Theme } from '../hooks/useTheme';\\nimport CollapsibleSidebar from '../components/ui/CollapsibleSidebar';\\nimport { useNavigator } from '../navigation/Navigator';\\nimport { useAppSettings } from '../hooks/useAppSettings';\\nimport { useProjectSettings } from '../hooks/useProjectSettings';\\nimport { useNotifications } from '../hooks/useNotifications';\\nimport { IconEdit, IconDelete, IconPlus } from '../components/ui/Icons';\\nimport { type ShortcutsModifier, type ShortcutsConfig, type AppSettings, DEFAULT_APP_SETTINGS } from '../../types/settings';\\n\\n// Settings Categories\\nconst CATEGORIES = [\\n  { id: 'visual', label: 'Visual', icon: <span aria-hidden>🎨</span>, accent: 'purple' },\\n  { id: 'llms', label: 'LLMs', icon: <span aria-hidden>🤖</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\n  { id: 'notifications', label: 'Notifications', icon: <span aria-hidden>🔔</span>, accent: 'brand' }\\n];\\n\\ntype CategoryId = typeof CATEGORIES[number]['id'];\\n\\nexport default function SettingsView() {\\n  const themes: Theme[] = ['light', 'dark'];\\n  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();\\n  const { isAppSettingsLoaded, appSettings, setNotificationSystemSettings, updateAppSettings } = useAppSettings();\\n  const { projectSettings, setNotificationProjectSettings } = useProjectSettings();\\n  const { enableNotifications } = useNotifications();\\n\\n  const { configs, activeConfigId, removeConfig, setActive } = useLLMConfig();\\n  const { openModal } = useNavigator();\\n\\n  // Layout state\\n  const [activeCategory, setActiveCategory] = useState<CategoryId>('visual');\\n\\n  // Helper: capture a combo from a keydown\\n  const captureCombo = useCallback((e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>): string => {\\n    const parts: string[] = [];\\n    if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) parts.push('Mod');\\n    if (e.shiftKey) parts.push('Shift');\\n    if (e.altKey) parts.push('Alt');\\n    // Base key\\n    const key = e.key;\\n    // Ignore modifier-only\\n    if (key && key !== 'Shift' && key !== 'Meta' && key !== 'Control' && key !== 'Alt') {\\n      if (key.length === 1) {\\n        parts.push(key.toUpperCase());\\n      } else {\\n        parts.push(key);\\n      }\\n    }\\n    return parts.length ? parts.join('+') : '';\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  const onShortcutChange = async (keyName: keyof ShortcutsConfig, combo: string) => {\\n    const next: AppSettings = await updateAppSettings({ userPreferences: { ...appSettings.userPreferences, shortcuts: { ...appSettings.userPreferences.shortcuts, [keyName]: combo } } });\\n    return next;\\n  };\\n\\n  const resetShortcutsToDefault = async () => {\\n    await updateAppSettings({ userPreferences: { ...appSettings.userPreferences, shortcuts: DEFAULT_APP_SETTINGS.userPreferences.shortcuts } });\\n  };\\n\\n  // Visual Settings content\\n  const renderVisualSection = () => (\\n    <div className=\\\"max-w-3xl\\\">\\n      <h2 className=\\\"text-xl font-semibold mb-3\\\">Appearance</h2>\\n      <div className=\\\"space-y-2\\\">\\n        <label htmlFor=\\\"theme\\\" className=\\\"block text-sm font-medium\\\">Theme</label>\\n        <select\\n          id=\\\"theme\\\"\\n          value={theme}\\n          onChange={(e) => {\\n            const t = e.target.value as Theme;\\n            setTheme(t);\\n            try { localStorage.setItem('theme', t);

Notifications system already exists with categories and OS toggle; we must ensure categories include these two and are exposed in settings. We also need to fire notifications at the right spots in the orchestrator/bridge logic. The rejection mentions feature completion signal is in messagesLog rather than a featureId, so we must detect a commit completion by inspecting factory-ts events or the messages logged by the agent orchestration. Next steps: inspect types/settings to see notification categories; inspect hooks/useProjectSettings and settingsManager to see default categories; add categories if missing. Then find where agent run completes in src/tools/factory/mainOrchestrator.js or orchestratorBridge.ts and emit a notificationsService.create call with category 'agent-finished'. For feature complete, find where commits are made or where messages log indicates commit; possibly packages/factory-ts/src/gitManager.ts or orchestrator events; if there isn't an explicit event to hook, add detection in orchestratorBridge that monitors bridge messages for commit completions and emits 'feature-completed' notification. Then update SettingsView to show toggles for these categories if not already dynamic. Finally, update notifications manager to respect categories (already does).\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"read_files\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"paths\": [\n          \"src/types/settings.ts\",\n          \"src/renderer/hooks/useProjectSettings.ts\",\n          \"src/settings/projectSettings.js\",\n          \"src/settings/manager.js\",\n          \"src/renderer/hooks/useNotifications.ts\",\n          \"src/ipcHandlersKeys.js\",\n          \"src/tools/factory/orchestratorBridge.ts\",\n          \"src/tools/factory/mainOrchestrator.js\",\n          \"packages/factory-ts/src/gitManager.ts\",\n          \"packages/factory-ts/src/orchestrator.ts\",\n          \"src/renderer/services/agentsService.ts\",\n          \"src/renderer/hooks/useAgents.ts\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: clicking a run finished notification takes the user to that agent run (ID: a45449ab-b745-460c-b065-6e92345ebd39)\n##DESCRIPTION: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now."

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: There's an addition \"_task\" feature log displayed in an agent run (ID: f1b430d4-d14d-437b-affb-d326d3227c41)\n##DESCRIPTION: This shouldn't happen.\nIt's displayed in @src/renderer/components/agents/ChatConversation.tsx and probably originates from:\n@packages/factory-ts/src/orchestrator.ts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step.

Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\",\"src/renderer/components/agents/ChatConversation.tsx\":\"import React, { useMemo, useRef, useState, useEffect, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';\\nimport type { AgentFeatureRunLog, AgentRun, AgentRunMessage } from '../../services/agentsService';\\nimport RichText from '../ui/RichText';\\nimport SafeText from '../ui/SafeText';\\nimport { ToolResult, AgentResponse, ToolCall } from 'packages/factory-ts/src/types';\\n\\n// Parse assistant JSON response to extract thoughts and tool calls safely\\nfunction parseAssistant(content: string): AgentResponse | null {\\n  try {\\n    const obj = JSON.parse(content);\\n    if (obj && typeof obj === 'object') return obj as AgentResponse;\\n    return null;\\n  } catch {\\n    return null;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nfunction JsonPreview({ value, maxChars = 200 }: { value: any; maxChars?: number }) {\\n  const str = typeof value === 'string' ? value : JSON.stringify(value, null, 2);\\n  if (str.length <= maxChars) return (<pre className=\\\"text-xs whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\\\">{str}</pre>);\\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <pre className=\\\"text-xs whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\\\">{open ? str : str.slice(0, maxChars) + '\\\\u2026'}</pre>\\n      <button className=\\\"btn-link text-xs mt-1\\\" onClick={() => setOpen(v => !v)}>{open ?

    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: All agent turn messages should show their thinking time next to the message bubble (ID: 065bac4d-1035-48de-9f17-2bbe2e35a300)\n##DESCRIPTION: This is inside @src/renderer/components/agents/ChatConversation.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\",\"src/renderer/components/agents/ChatConversation.tsx\":\"import React, { useMemo, useRef, useState, useEffect, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';\\nimport type { AgentFeatureRunLog, AgentRun, AgentRunMessage } from '../../services/agentsService';\\nimport RichText from '../ui/RichText';\\nimport SafeText from '../ui/SafeText';\\nimport { ToolResult, AgentResponse, ToolCall } from 'packages/factory-ts/src/types';\\n\\n// Parse assistant JSON response to extract thoughts and tool calls safely\\nfunction parseAssistant(content: string): AgentResponse | null {\\n  try {\\n    const obj = JSON.parse(content);\\n    if (obj && typeof obj === 'object') return obj as AgentResponse;\\n    return null;\\n  } catch {\\n    return null;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nfunction JsonPreview({ value, maxChars = 200 }: { value: any; maxChars?: number }) {\\n  const str = typeof value === 'string' ? value : JSON.stringify(value, null, 2);\\n  if (str.length <= maxChars) return (<pre className=\\\"text-xs whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\\\">{str}</pre>);\\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <pre className=\\\"text-xs whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\\\">{open ? str : str.slice(0, maxChars) + '\\\\u2026'}</pre>\\n      <button className=\\\"btn-link text-xs mt-1\\\" onClick={() => setOpen(v => !v)}>{open ?

Each feature should be a small, logical, and testable unit of work. Use the `create_feature` tool for each one you identify.\\\\\\\\n3.  **Finish**: Once the features are created, you **MUST** call the `finish_spec` tool to complete your assignment.\\\\\\\\n4.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_task` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Notes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thoughts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I need to propose concrete, atomic UI improvement features grounded in the existing React/Electron renderer. I'll inspect key UI components (Button, Input, Modal, Tooltip, Select), navigation (SidebarView), theming (useTheme), shortcuts (useShortcuts), and representative screens to identify common UI enhancement opportunities (accessibility, loading states, empty states, consistency, theming). Based on findings, I will create a set of small, implementable features and then finish the spec.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"read_files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"paths\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Button.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Input.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Modal.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Select.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/CollapsibleSidebar.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/CommandMenu.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/ShortcutsHelp.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/hooks/useShortcuts.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/hooks/useTheme.ts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/App.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/navigation/SidebarView.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/tasks/TasksListView.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Spinner.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n        ]\\\\\\\\n      }\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"read_files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/components/ui/Button.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"import * as React from 'react'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { Slot } from '@radix-ui/react-slot'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport Spinner from './Spinner'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction cx(...parts: Array<string | false | null | undefined>) {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  return parts.filter(Boolean).join(' ')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nexport type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'danger' | 'link'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nexport type ButtonSize = 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'icon'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nexport interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  asChild?: boolean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  variant?: ButtonVariant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  size?: ButtonSize\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  loading?: boolean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconst variantClass: Record<ButtonVariant, string> = {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  primary: 'btn btn-primary',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  secondary: 'btn btn-secondary',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  outline: 'btn btn-outline',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ghost: 'btn btn-ghost',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  danger: 'btn btn-danger',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  link: 'btn btn-link',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconst sizeClass: Record<ButtonSize, string> = {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  sm: 'btn-sm',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  md: '',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  lg: 'btn-lg',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  icon: 'btn-icon',\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconst Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ({ className, asChild = false, variant = 'primary', size = 'md', loading = false, disabled, children, ...props }, ref) => {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    const Comp = asChild ?

    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: when switching views - the prefs for which view is stored in TasksView is lost (ID: 8d6c71e6-f74b-4155-bdd2-56baa2bbd40a)\n##DESCRIPTION: When switching screens from the @src/renderer/screens/TasksView.tsx to any other of the screens in the @src/renderer/navigation/SidebarView.tsx it resets the previous status selection and sorting selection. This shouldn't happen - these preferences must be kept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\",\"src/renderer/screens/TasksView.tsx\":\"import
