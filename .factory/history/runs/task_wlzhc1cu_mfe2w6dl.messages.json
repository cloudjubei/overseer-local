Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\n##TITLE:\nUI Improvements\n##DESCRIPTION:\nVarious UI improvements to the app\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Agent runs in the history don't show any messages (ID: c2679a2e-98a3-46d7-9315-2935e54c2f05)\n##DESCRIPTION: Somehow the code responsible for reading the data must be wrong.\nIf any changes would have to be made in the 'thefactory-tools' project - outline them all in a document `docs/CHANGES.md`.\nThe runs are viewed inside @src/renderer/screens/AgentsView.tsx and @src/renderer/components/agents/ChatConversation.tsx .\n\n\n\n\n#ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n    - settings/: AppSettings React context provider used app-wide (singleton).\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\",\"src/renderer/screens/AgentsView.tsx\":\"import React, { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from 'react';\\nimport { useAgents } from '../hooks/useAgents';\\nimport { useActiveProject } from '../projects/ProjectContext';\\nimport type { AgentRun } from '../services/agentsService';\\nimport ChatConversation from '../components/agents/ChatConversation';\\nimport AgentRunRow from '../components/agents/AgentRunRow';\\nimport ModelChip from '../components/agents/ModelChip';\\n\\nfunction formatTime(iso?: string) {\\n  if (!iso) return '';\\n  try {\\n    const d = new Date(iso);\\n    return d.toLocaleTimeString();\\n  } catch {\\n    return iso ??

You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Workflow\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\\\\\\\\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\\\\\\\\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\\\\\\\\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\\\\\\\\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Notes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\\\\\\\\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\\\\\\\\n##TITLE:\\\\\\\\nUI Improvements\\\\\\\\n##DESCRIPTION:\\\\\\\\nVarious UI improvements to the app\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Loading screen (ID: 270271e3-5a53-45ed-9c31-131e9bb4f36b)\\\\\\\\n##DESCRIPTION: We need a loading screen that will show at the beginning of app launch, while all necessary things are being loaded.\\\\\\\\nFor the time being - that's just the user preferences and app settings.\\\\\\\\n@src/renderer/App.tsx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\\\\\\\\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\\\\\\\\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\\\\\\\\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\\\\\\\\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\\\\\\\\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\\\\\\\\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\\\\\\\\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\\\\\\\\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\\\\\\\\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\\\\\\\\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n[object Object]\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\\\\\\\\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\\\\\\\\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"# File Organisation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPurpose\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or historical notes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTop-Level Layout\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhere to Learn More\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConventions (brief)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNotes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/App.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"import { useEffect } from 'react';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport SidebarView from './navigation/SidebarView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ModalHost from './navigation/ModalHost';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { ToastProvider } from './components/ui/Toast';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { NavigatorProvider, useNavigator } from './navigation/Navigator';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { ShortcutsProvider, useShortcuts } from './hooks/useShortcuts';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport CommandMenu from './components/ui/CommandMenu';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ShortcutsHelp from './components/ui/ShortcutsHelp';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { NotificationMetadata } from '../types/notifications';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { ProjectsProvider } from './projects/ProjectContext';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAppSettings } from './hooks/useAppSettings';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useTheme } from './hooks/useTheme';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport useLiveData from './hooks/useLiveData';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconst UI_IMPROVEMENTS_TASK_ID = 'f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction ServicesBootstrap() {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const { init } = useLiveData();\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  useEffect(() => { \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    init();

The primary file to modify is `src/renderer/App.tsx`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFrom the existing `App.tsx`, I can see that a hook `useAppSettings` is used in a child component (`GlobalShortcutsBootstrap`). This hook is the source for application settings. The fact that the code accesses `appSettings.userPreferences.shortcuts` without any checks suggests that `appSettings` is already populated when the component renders. A common modern React pattern for ensuring data is present before rendering is to use Suspense.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy plan is as follows:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.  I'll assume that the `useAppSettings` hook integrates with React's Suspense mechanism. This means it will signal to React that it's fetching data, and React will find the nearest `<Suspense>` boundary to show a fallback UI.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2.  I will create a simple `LoadingScreen` component to be used as the fallback UI. This component will display a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Loading...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" message and will be styled to be centered on the screen.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3.  I will refactor the existing `App` component. The current content of `App` will be moved into a new component called `AppContent`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4.  The main `App` component will then render `AppContent` wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary, with the `LoadingScreen` component set as the `fallback`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5.  The `initTheme()` call, which was in `App`, will be moved into `AppContent`. This is to ensure that the theme is initialized only after the settings (which might contain theme information) have been successfully loaded.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis approach is clean, leverages modern React features, and directly addresses the requirement of showing a loading UI while data is being fetched, without needing to know the specific implementation details of the `useAppSettings` hook, other than that it supports Suspense.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"write_file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/App.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"import { useEffect, Suspense } from 'react';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport SidebarView from './navigation/SidebarView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ModalHost from './navigation/ModalHost';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { ToastProvider } from './components/ui/Toast';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { NavigatorProvider, useNavigator } from './navigation/Navigator';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { ShortcutsProvider, useShortcuts } from './hooks/useShortcuts';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport CommandMenu from './components/ui/CommandMenu';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ShortcutsHelp from './components/ui/ShortcutsHelp';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { NotificationMetadata } from '../types/notifications';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { ProjectsProvider } from './projects/ProjectContext';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAppSettings } from './hooks/useAppSettings';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useTheme } from './hooks/useTheme';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport useLiveData from './hooks/useLiveData';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconst UI_IMPROVEMENTS_TASK_ID = 'f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction ServicesBootstrap() {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const { init } = useLiveData();\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  useEffect(() => { \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    init();

You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\\\\\\\\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\\\\\\\\n##TITLE:\\\\\\\\nUI Improvements\\\\\\\\n##DESCRIPTION:\\\\\\\\nVarious UI improvements to the app\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: when switching projects - go to the base of a given screen (ID: 8eb99cfc-6aeb-4f17-ae04-73621bdd63ce)\\\\\\\\n##DESCRIPTION: Right now when viewing a task and switching projects - it shows that task from the new project's perspective which isn't found.\\\\\\\\nWe need to make sure that in such cases we go to the main sidebar screen - in the task example - @src/renderer/tasks/TasksListView.tsx .\\\\\\\\n@src/renderer/navigation/SidebarView.tsx is where we switch projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\\\\\\\\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\\\\\\\\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\\\\\\\\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\\\\\\\\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\\\\\\\\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\\\\\\\\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\\\\\\\\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\\\\\\\\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\\\\\\\\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\\\\\\\\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n[object Object]\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\\\\\\\\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\\\\\\\\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"# File Organisation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPurpose\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or historical notes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTop-Level Layout\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhere to Learn More\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConventions (brief)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNotes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/tasks/TasksListView.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"import React, { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { Button } from '../components/ui/Button'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useNavigator } from '../navigation/Navigator'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport BoardView from './BoardView'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport SegmentedControl from '../components/ui/SegmentedControl'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useActiveProject } from '../projects/ProjectContext'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport DependencyBullet from '../components/tasks/DependencyBullet'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport StatusControl, { StatusPicker, statusKey } from '../components/tasks/StatusControl'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { STATUS_LABELS } from '../services/tasksService';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useTasks } from '../hooks/useTasks'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAppSettings } from '../hooks/useAppSettings'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { TaskListViewSorting, TaskViewMode, TaskListStatusFilter } from '../../types/settings'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAgents } from '../hooks/useAgents'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { Status, Task } from 'thefactory-tools';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ExclamationChip from '../components/tasks/ExclamationChip'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { BoardIcon, IconEdit, IconPlay, IconPlus, ListIcon } from '../components/ui/Icons'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport AgentRunBullet from '../components/agents/AgentRunBullet'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport RunAgentButton from '../components/tasks/RunAgentButton'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { RichText } from '../components/ui/RichText'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ModelChip from '../components/agents/ModelChip'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport Skeleton, { SkeletonText } from '../components/ui/Skeleton'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction countFeatures(task: Task) {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const features = Array.isArray(task.features) ? task.features : []\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const total = features.length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const done = features.filter((f) => f.status === '+').length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  return { done, total }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction matchesQuery(task: Task, q: string) {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  if (!q) return true\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const s = q.trim().toLowerCase()\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  if (!s) return true\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const idStr = String(task.id || '')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  return idStr.includes(s) || task.title?.toLowerCase().includes(s) || task.description?.toLowerCase().includes(s)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction filterTasks(tasks: Task[], { query, status }: { query: string;

The desired behavior is to navigate to the base screen for the current view (e.g., the tasks list) when a project is switched. The project switching happens in `src/renderer/navigation/SidebarView.tsx`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe current implementation calls `setActiveProjectId(p.id)` directly on button click. This changes the project context, but doesn't change the URL or navigation state, causing the component for the specific item to re-render with an ID that doesn't exist in the new project.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe `useNavigator` hook provides a `navigateView` function and the `currentView`. My hypothesis is that `navigateView(currentView)` will reset the navigation for the current view to its root. For example, if the user is on a task detail page, `currentView` would be 'Home', and calling `navigateView('Home')` should navigate them to the main tasks list.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo implement this, I will:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.  Create a new handler function `handleProjectSwitch` in `SidebarView.tsx`.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2.  This function will first check if the selected project is already active. If not, it will call `setActiveProjectId` to switch the project, and then call `navigateView(currentView)` to reset the view.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3.  I will update the `onClick` handler for the project switching button to call this new `handleProjectSwitch` function.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"write_file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/navigation/SidebarView.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport TasksView from '../screens/TasksView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport FilesView from '../screens/FilesView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport SettingsView from '../screens/SettingsView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ChatView from '../screens/ChatView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport NotificationsView from '../screens/NotificationsView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport AgentsView from '../screens/AgentsView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport AllAgentsView from '../screens/AllAgentsView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport LiveDataView from '../screens/LiveDataView';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useNavigator } from './Navigator';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport Tooltip from '../components/ui/Tooltip';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useNotifications } from '../hooks/useNotifications';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n// import { useShortcuts } from '../hooks/useShortcuts';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { MAIN_PROJECT, useProjectContext } from '../projects/ProjectContext';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport type { NavigationView } from '../types';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAppSettings } from '../hooks/useAppSettings';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAgents } from '../hooks/useAgents';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport NotificationBadge from '../components/tasks/NotificationBadge';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { ProjectSpec } from 'thefactory-tools';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nexport type SidebarProps = {};\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction classNames(...xs: Array<string | false | null | undefined>) {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  return xs.filter(Boolean).join(' ')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntype NavDef = {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  label: string;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  view: NavigationView;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  icon: React.ReactNode;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  accent?: 'brand' | 'purple' | 'teal' | 'gray';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconst NAV_ITEMS: NavDef[] = [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'home', label: 'Home', view: 'Home', icon: <span aria-hidden>🏠</span>, accent: 'brand' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'files', label: 'Files', view: 'Files', icon: <span aria-hidden>📚</span>, accent: 'purple' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'chat', label: 'Chat', view: 'Chat', icon: <span aria-hidden>💬</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'agents', label: 'Agents', view: 'Agents', icon: <span aria-hidden>🤖</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'live-data', label: 'Live Data', view: 'LiveData', icon: <span aria-hidden>📡</span>, accent: 'brand' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'notifications', label: 'Notifications', view: 'Notifications', icon: <span aria-hidden>🔔</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'settings', label: 'Settings', view: 'Settings', icon: <span aria-hidden>⚙️</span>, accent: 'gray' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  { id: 'all-agents', label: 'All Agents', view: 'AllAgents', icon: <span aria-hidden>🗂️</span>, accent: 'teal' },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n];\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction useMediaQuery(query: string) {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const [matches, setMatches] = useState<boolean>(() => typeof window !== 'undefined' ?

You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Workflow\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\\\\\\\\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\\\\\\\\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\\\\\\\\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\\\\\\\\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Notes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\\\\\\\\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f67e8921-b197-40c9-9154-e95db8f27deb)\\\\\\\\n##TITLE:\\\\\\\\nUI Improvements\\\\\\\\n##DESCRIPTION:\\\\\\\\nVarious UI improvements to the app\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: when switching screens or projects - the Tasks view and sort get reset to defaults (ID: 943be0ce-0c96-48ab-a820-37b919b9a150)\\\\\\\\n##DESCRIPTION: This shouldn't be the case. Whenever @src/renderer/tasks/TasksListView.tsx is opened, it should always show the defaults inside user preferences @src/renderer/hooks/useAppSettings.ts as the first thing.\\\\\\\\nThere seems to be some sort of race condition where the defaults override the stored preferences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\\\\\\\\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\\\\\\\\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\\\\\\\\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\\\\\\\\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\\\\\\\\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\\\\\\\\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\\\\\\\\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\\\\\\\\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\\\\\\\\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\\\\\\\\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n[object Object]\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\\\\\\\\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\\\\\\\\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"# File Organisation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPurpose\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems.

The root cause appears to be a race condition. The component `TasksListView.tsx` uses the `useAppSettings` hook, which initializes with default settings and then asynchronously loads user preferences. If a user interacts with a settings control before the preferences are loaded, the action of changing one setting (e.g., view mode) can cause the entire set of user preferences to be saved with a mix of the new value and defaults for all other values, effectively wiping out the user's other preferences.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo fix this, I will prevent user interaction with the controls that modify these settings until the application settings have been fully loaded. The `useAppSettings` hook provides an `isAppSettingsLoaded` boolean that I can use for this purpose.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn `src/renderer/tasks/TasksListView.tsx`, one control (the sorting dropdown) already correctly uses this flag to disable itself. I will apply the same logic to the other controls:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.  **Status Filter**: This is a `div` element acting as a button. I will make its `onClick` and `onKeyDown` handlers conditional on `isAppSettingsLoaded`. I will also set `tabIndex` to `-1` and add `aria-disabled=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` when settings are not loaded to make it inaccessible.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2.  **View Mode Switcher (`SegmentedControl`)**: I will add a `disabled={!isAppSettingsLoaded}` prop to this component. This is a standard prop for control components, and I assume it's supported.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThese changes will be confined to `src/renderer/tasks/TasksListView.tsx` and will effectively prevent the race condition by blocking the user action that triggers it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"write_file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/renderer/tasks/TasksListView.tsx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"import React, { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { Button } from '../components/ui/Button'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useNavigator } from '../navigation/Navigator'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport BoardView from './BoardView'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport SegmentedControl from '../components/ui/SegmentedControl'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useActiveProject } from '../projects/ProjectContext'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport DependencyBullet from '../components/tasks/DependencyBullet'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport StatusControl, { StatusPicker, statusKey } from '../components/tasks/StatusControl'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { STATUS_LABELS } from '../services/tasksService';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useTasks } from '../hooks/useTasks'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAppSettings } from '../hooks/useAppSettings'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { TaskListViewSorting, TaskViewMode, TaskListStatusFilter } from '../../types/settings'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { useAgents } from '../hooks/useAgents'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { Status, Task } from 'thefactory-tools';\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ExclamationChip from '../components/tasks/ExclamationChip'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { BoardIcon, IconEdit, IconPlay, IconPlus, ListIcon } from '../components/ui/Icons'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport AgentRunBullet from '../components/agents/AgentRunBullet'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport RunAgentButton from '../components/tasks/RunAgentButton'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport { RichText } from '../components/ui/RichText'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport ModelChip from '../components/agents/ModelChip'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimport Skeleton, { SkeletonText } from '../components/ui/Skeleton'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfunction countFeatures(task: Task) {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  const features = Array.isArray(task.features) ?

The fix was implemented in this app's renderer UI to robustly select feature logs for display.\\n\\nWhat changed in this app\\n- ChatConversation now:\\n  - Normalizes incoming messagesLog defensively (accepts object or array shapes).\\n  - Prefers non-task feature conversations when present and non-empty.\\n  - Falls back to the task-level (__task__) conversation when it exists and has messages.\\n  - Avoids a case where a secondary empty feature group caused the task-level conversation to be filtered out, resulting in no messages displayed.\\n\\nRecommendations for thefactory-tools (optional improvements)\\n- Ensure `history.getRunMessages(runId)` consistently returns a feature-keyed object with the following shape:\\n  {\\n    \\\"<featureId>\\\": { featureId, startDate, endDate?, messages: Message[] },\\n    \\\"__task__\\\": { featureId: \\\"__task__\\\", startDate, endDate?, messages: Message[] }\\n  }\\n  where startDate/endDate are ISO strings, and messages is an array of normalized messages.\\n- If returning a raw array (legacy), consider including feature grouping (messageGroups) in the API response to reduce the need for client-side inference.\\n- When no feature-level conversations exist, ensure the task-level group is still present with any available messages.\\n\\nRationale\\n- The UI needs a stable, predictable structure to render conversations. Inconsistent shapes or inclusion of empty feature groups alongside a populated `__task__` group can lead to confusing results unless the UI applies additional heuristics.\\n\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"finish_feature\",\"arguments\":{}}]}",
