Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`.

But these don't have all the latest functionality that we require (CREATE EXTENSION vector) . We need to modify all the code and especially the README.md to walk a user through 2 options:\n1) having a local PostgresSQL running and providing access to it via url\n2) running PostgresSQL in docker.\nBoth options need to be explained from scratch - for option 2 assuming the user has docker installed, but for option 1 assuming they have nothing.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Update README.md with PostgreSQL setup instructions (ID: 6a9e96d4-5abe-4777-84e9-db952ed87c0b)\n##DESCRIPTION: Modify the README.md to provide two clear options for setting up a PostgreSQL database: 1. Installing and running PostgreSQL locally. 2. Running PostgreSQL using Docker. For option 2, provide a `docker-compose.yml` file and instructions on how to use it. These instructions should replace the existing setup guide that relies on an embedded database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object.

You can depend on it as a local file dependency (`\\\"thefactory-db\\\": \\\"file:../thefactory-db\\\"`) or publish it to a private registry.\\n\\nDatabase connection is provided via a Postgres connection string.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\nTo use `thefactory-db`, you need a running PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension enabled. You have two options:\\n\\n### Option 1: Local PostgreSQL Installation\\n\\n1.  **Install PostgreSQL**: Follow the official guides for your operating system:\\n    *   [macOS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html) (e.g., via `brew install postgresql`)\\n    *   [Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html) (use the installer)\\n    *   [Linux](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html) (e.g., `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib`)\\n\\n2.  **Start PostgreSQL**: Ensure the PostgreSQL service is running.\\n\\n3.  **Create a database and user**:\\n    *   Open the PostgreSQL command-line tool (`psql`).\\n    *   Run the following SQL commands:\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    CREATE DATABASE thefactorydb;\\n    CREATE USER \\\"user\\\" WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';\\n    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE thefactorydb TO \\\"user\\\";\\n    ```\\n    *   Connect to your new database: `\\\\c thefactorydb`\\n\\n4.  **Enable the vector extension**:\\n    *   You need to install `pgvector`. Follow the instructions for your OS from the [pgvector GitHub repository](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).\\n    *   Once installed, connect to your database (`psql -d thefactorydb`) and run:\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;\\n    ```\\n\\n5.  **Set your connection URL**: Your database connection string will be:\\n    `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thefactorydb`\\n\\n### Option 2: Docker\\n\\nIf you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can easily set up a PostgreSQL instance with `pgvector`.\\n\\n1.  **Use the `docker-compose.yml` file**: This repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file for your convenience.\\n\\n2.  **Start the container**:\\n    Run the following command in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    docker-compose up -d\\n    ```\\n    This will start a PostgreSQL container in the background. The `pgvector` extension is automatically available in the `pgvector/pgvector` image.\\n\\n3.  **Connection URL**: The database will be available at:\\n    `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thefactorydb`\\n\\n## Populating the Database\\n\\nOnce your database is running, you can use the populate script to initialize the schema and ingest files.\\n\\n1.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`\\n2.  **Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable**:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    export DATABASE_URL=\\\"postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thefactorydb\\\"\\n    ```\\n\\n3.  **Run the populate script:** This will initialize the database, ingest files from `src/` and `docs/`, and run a sample hybrid search query.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm run populate -- --root . --reset\\n    ```\\n\\nSee `scripts/populate.ts` for details on command-line flags. The script uses the `DATABASE_URL` by default.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { openDatabase } from 'thefactory-db'\\n\\n// Set DATABASE_URL in your environment or provide it directly\\nconst db = await openDatabase({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });\\n\\n// Add an entity\\nconst entity = await db.addEntity({\\n  type: 'internal_document',\\n  content: 'This is a test document about hybrid search.',\\n  metadata: { author: 'dev' }\\n});\\n\\n// Perform a hybrid search\\nconst results = await db.searchEntities({\\n  query: 'hybrid search test',\\n  textWeight: 0.6, // Blend text and vector scores\\n  limit: 5\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(results);\\n```\\n\\nThe `openDatabase` function will:\\n1.  Connect to your PostgreSQL database.\\n2.  Apply the latest schema from `docs/sql/schema.pg.sql`.\\n3.  Ensure the `vector` extension is enabled.\\n\\nThe returned `db` object provides an API for adding and searching entities, as well as a `raw()` method for direct `pg.Pool` access.\\n\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"finish_feature\",\"arguments\":{}}]}",

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 08660cf9-08cc-4e96-84e7-977dfe6cb58f)\n##TITLE:\nThis project needs to rely on an PostgreSQL database that is provided via url\n##DESCRIPTION:\nCurrently we were relying on having a local embedded PostgresSQL database running. But these don't have all the latest functionality that we require (CREATE EXTENSION vector) . We need to modify all the code and especially the README.md to walk a user through 2 options:\n1) having a local PostgresSQL running and providing access to it via url\n2) running PostgresSQL in docker.\nBoth options need to be explained from scratch - for option 2 assuming the user has docker installed, but for option 1 assuming they have nothing.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Update populate script to rely on DATABASE_URL (ID: 91efa563-0b29-4a73-b470-0e6321d95c93)\n##DESCRIPTION: Modify `scripts/populate.ts` to remove any logic that depends on the embedded database. The script should now exclusively use a PostgreSQL connection URL, which can be provided via the `--url` flag or the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Ensure the script's documentation and argument parsing are updated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File and Tooling Organisation\\n\\nOverview\\n- thefactory-db is a standalone, local-first PostgreSQL package with FTS text search (tsvector) and vector similarity (pgvector) for hybrid search across files and documents.\\n- It is designed to be reusable across projects. You can depend on it as a local file dependency (\\\"thefactory-db\\\": \\\"file:../thefactory-db\\\") or publish it to a private registry.\\n- Database connection is provided via a Postgres connection string so multiple projects can access the same DB (ensure access strategy avoids concurrency hazards at the application layer).\\n\\nTop-level Layout\\n- README.md: Quick-start usage and populate script instructions.\\n- package.json, tsconfig.json: Build and TypeScript configuration.\\n- src/: Source code for the database wrapper and types.\\n- docs/: Human-facing documentation for this package (this file).\\n  - docs/sql/: SQL files for schema, DML and search queries (PostgreSQL flavor).\\n- scripts/: Development/utility scripts (e.g., populate.ts to ingest files and test search).\\n\\nKey Source Modules (src/)\\n- src/index.ts: Public entry point. Exports openDatabase(options) which returns a Database API instance. The instance provides:\\n  - addEntity({ type, content?, metadata? }): Promise<Entity> — Inserts an entity with embedding.\\n  - searchEntities({ query, textWeight?, limit?, types? }): Promise<EntityWithScore[]> — Hybrid search combining ts_rank and vector cosine similarity.\\n  - raw(): pg.Pool — Gives low-level access for advanced SQL.\\n- src/types.ts: Shared TypeScript types:\\n  - EntityType = 'project_file' | 'internal_document' | 'external_blob'\\n  - Entity shape for insertion and retrieval\\n  - Search options and result row types\\n  - OpenDbOptions: now supports either an external connection string or a local data directory for an embedded Postgres runtime.\\n- src/connection.ts: Connection factory and schema init. Loads SQL from docs/sql/schema.pg.sql and ensures pgvector extension. Includes ensureEmbeddedPostgres() which boots a local Postgres using pg-embedded given a data directory and returns a connection string. openPostgres() accepts either a connectionString or databaseDir and will start the embedded server when needed.\\n\\nDatabase Schema\\n- entities table fields:\\n  - id (uuid primary key)\\n  - type (text: 'project_file' | 'internal_document' | 'external_blob')\\n  - content (text, optional)\\n  - fts (tsvector, generated from content)\\n  - embedding (vector(1536))\\n  - created_at, updated_at (timestamptz)\\n  - metadata (jsonb, optional)\\n\\nHybrid Search\\n- searchEntities merges text rank (ts_rank_cd over tsvector using websearch_to_tsquery) and vector cosine similarity using a weight factor (textWeight in [0,1]).\\n- The SQL for hybrid search is defined in docs/sql/search_entities.pg.sql and composed dynamically with optional type filters.\\n\\nScripts (scripts/)\\n- scripts/populate.ts: CLI tool to scan a project and ingest src/ and docs/ into the DB, then run a sample hybrid search.\\n  - Flags:\\n    - --root <path> (default: cwd) Project root to scan\\n    - --url <postgres-url> (default: DATABASE_URL or localhost)\\n    - --textWeight <0..1> (default: 0.6) Weight for text vs vector\\n    - --reset (boolean) TRUNCATE entities\\n\\nLocal PostgreSQL Runtime\\n- This project includes the pg-embedded dependency to enable running a self-contained PostgreSQL instance without relying on external services.\\n- SQL files under docs/sql/ continue to be the single source of truth for schema and queries (loaded at runtime by utility functions, e.g., readSql).\\n- Consumers can configure the database data directory path with OpenDbOptions.databaseDir. If not provided, the implementation uses a default directory ./.thefactory-db/pgdata within the current working directory. Alternatively, provide OpenDbOptions.connectionString to connect to an existing PostgreSQL instance.\\n\\nUsage in Other Projects\\n- Add as a local dependency or install from your registry. Provide either a Postgres connection string or rely on the embedded runtime with a default data directory.\\n- Example:\\n  - import { openDatabase } from 'thefactory-db'\\n  - const db = await openDatabase({ databaseDir: \\\".thefactory-db/pgdata\\\" }) // or omit for default\\n  - // or: const db = await openDatabase({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL })\\n  - await db.addEntity(...); const rows = await db.searchEntities(...);\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 08660cf9-08cc-4e96-84e7-977dfe6cb58f)\n##TITLE:\nThis project needs to rely on an PostgreSQL database that is provided via url\n##DESCRIPTION:\nCurrently we were relying on having a local embedded PostgresSQL database running. But these don't have all the latest functionality that we require (CREATE EXTENSION vector) . We need to modify all the code and especially the README.md to walk a user through 2 options:\n1) having a local PostgresSQL running and providing access to it via url\n2) running PostgresSQL in docker.\nBoth options need to be explained from scratch - for option 2 assuming the user has docker installed, but for option 1 assuming they have nothing.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create docker-compose.yml for local development (ID: a16dcb52-9df8-40d3-82bf-c2600c8df0ac)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the project. This file should define a PostgreSQL service with the `pgvector` extension enabled. Include environment variables for the user, password, and database name. Ensure the port is mapped to the host machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File and Tooling Organisation\\n\\nOverview\\n- thefactory-db is a standalone, local-first PostgreSQL package with FTS text search (tsvector) and vector similarity (pgvector) for hybrid search across files and documents.\\n- It is designed to be reusable across projects. You can depend on it as a local file dependency (\\\"thefactory-db\\\": \\\"file:../thefactory-db\\\") or publish it to a private registry.\\n- Database connection is provided via a Postgres connection string so multiple projects can access the same DB (ensure access strategy avoids concurrency hazards at the application layer).\\n\\nTop-level Layout\\n- README.md: Quick-start usage and populate script instructions.\\n- package.json, tsconfig.json: Build and TypeScript configuration.\\n- src/: Source code for the database wrapper and types.\\n- docs/: Human-facing documentation for this package (this file).\\n  - docs/sql/: SQL files for schema, DML and search queries (PostgreSQL flavor).\\n- scripts/: Development/utility scripts (e.g., populate.ts to ingest files and test search).\\n\\nKey Source Modules (src/)\\n- src/index.ts: Public entry point. Exports openDatabase(options) which returns a Database API instance. The instance provides:\\n  - addEntity({ type, content?, metadata? }): Promise<Entity> — Inserts an entity with embedding.\\n  - searchEntities({ query, textWeight?, limit?, types? }): Promise<EntityWithScore[]> — Hybrid search combining ts_rank and vector cosine similarity.\\n  - raw(): pg.Pool — Gives low-level access for advanced SQL.\\n- src/types.ts: Shared TypeScript types:\\n  - EntityType = 'project_file' | 'internal_document' | 'external_blob'\\n  - Entity shape for insertion and retrieval\\n  - Search options and result row types\\n  - OpenDbOptions: now supports either an external connection string or a local data directory for an embedded Postgres runtime.\\n- src/connection.ts: Connection factory and schema init. Loads SQL from docs/sql/schema.pg.sql and ensures pgvector extension. Includes ensureEmbeddedPostgres() which boots a local Postgres using pg-embedded given a data directory and returns a connection string. openPostgres() accepts either a connectionString or databaseDir and will start the embedded server when needed.\\n\\nDatabase Schema\\n- entities table fields:\\n  - id (uuid primary key)\\n  - type (text: 'project_file' | 'internal_document' | 'external_blob')\\n  - content (text, optional)\\n  - fts (tsvector, generated from content)\\n  - embedding (vector(1536))\\n  - created_at, updated_at (timestamptz)\\n  - metadata (jsonb, optional)\\n\\nHybrid Search\\n- searchEntities merges text rank (ts_rank_cd over tsvector using websearch_to_tsquery) and vector cosine similarity using a weight factor (textWeight in [0,1]).\\n- The SQL for hybrid search is defined in docs/sql/search_entities.pg.sql and composed dynamically with optional type filters.\\n\\nScripts (scripts/)\\n- scripts/populate.ts: CLI tool to scan a project and ingest src/ and docs/ into the DB, then run a sample hybrid search.\\n  - Flags:\\n    - --root <path> (default: cwd) Project root to scan\\n    - --url <postgres-url> (default: DATABASE_URL or localhost)\\n    - --textWeight <0..1> (default: 0.6) Weight for text vs vector\\n    - --reset (boolean) TRUNCATE entities\\n\\nLocal PostgreSQL Runtime\\n- This project includes the pg-embedded dependency to enable running a self-contained PostgreSQL instance without relying on external services.\\n- SQL files under docs/sql/ continue to be the single source of truth for schema and queries (loaded at runtime by utility functions, e.g., readSql).\\n- Consumers can configure the database data directory path with OpenDbOptions.databaseDir. If not provided, the implementation uses a default directory ./.thefactory-db/pgdata within the current working directory. Alternatively, provide OpenDbOptions.connectionString to connect to an existing PostgreSQL instance.\\n\\nUsage in Other Projects\\n- Add as a local dependency or install from your registry. Provide either a Postgres connection string or rely on the embedded runtime with a default data directory.\\n- Example:\\n  - import { openDatabase } from 'thefactory-db'\\n  - const db = await openDatabase({ databaseDir: \\\".thefactory-db/pgdata\\\" }) // or omit for default\\n  - // or: const db = await openDatabase({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL })\\n  - await db.addEntity(...); const rows = await db.searchEntities(...);\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 08660cf9-08cc-4e96-84e7-977dfe6cb58f)\n##TITLE:\nThis project needs to rely on an PostgreSQL database that is provided via url\n##DESCRIPTION:\nCurrently we were relying on having a local embedded PostgresSQL database running. But these don't have all the latest functionality that we require (CREATE EXTENSION vector) . We need to modify all the code and especially the README.md to walk a user through 2 options:\n1) having a local PostgresSQL running and providing access to it via url\n2) running PostgresSQL in docker.\nBoth options need to be explained from scratch - for option 2 assuming the user has docker installed, but for option 1 assuming they have nothing.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Update FILE_ORGANISATION.md to reflect removal of embedded database (ID: 48699765-ac45-471f-bc06-c938db4b28e3)\n##DESCRIPTION: Update `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to remove all references to the embedded PostgreSQL runtime (`pg-embedded`). The documentation should now state that the project requires an external PostgreSQL connection string. Update the descriptions of `src/connection.ts` and `OpenDbOptions` to reflect this change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File and Tooling Organisation\\n\\nOverview\\n- thefactory-db is a standalone, local-first PostgreSQL package with FTS text search (tsvector) and vector similarity (pgvector) for hybrid search across files and documents.\\n- It is designed to be reusable across projects.
