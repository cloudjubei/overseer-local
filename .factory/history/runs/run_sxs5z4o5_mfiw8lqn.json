Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 80ed9778-d7d8-421f-818a-1027f98a580f)\n##TITLE:\nSeparate Entities from Documents\n##DESCRIPTION:\nFor the database to work as intended for the required use, we actually need two types of tables:\nEntities and Documents.\nDocuments will always assume that their content is a string.\nEntities will have their content as json.\nFor tokens and embeddings - Entities should have their content stringified, but if possible, only based on values and not on keys or json schema characters like braces or colons - as those only pollute the tokenization/embedding.\nBoth will have a type string associated with them. This means, that we need functions to get Documents and Entities of a specific type.\nIt also means that we must be able to filter inside search based on a list of ids or type - an example of how this is done is in the reference hybrid_search @docs/hybrid_search.sql .\nFor Entities, as their content is json, we also want a function matchEntities - that will allow to get entities whose content matches a specific json value, for instance `{ 'info': { 'category' : 'text' } }`.\n\nEssentially, the current Entities that are implemented right now become Documents with a few improvements, and we need a completely new schema for the new Entities. \nThere's no need for any backward-compatibility.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Update scripts to use Documents API and demonstrate Entities (ID: d54cd46a-ac74-4dc3-a68b-ad7426eef158)\n##DESCRIPTION: Modify scripts:\n- populate.ts: switch ingestion to use addDocument and searchDocuments; TRUNCATE documents instead of entities when --reset is provided; adjust type inference to use string type and metadata unchanged.\n- example.ts: demonstrate creating a few documents and entities (with JSON content), then run searchDocuments and optionally searchEntities; log results.\n- clear.ts: TRUNCATE documents and entities (both), or at minimum documents; print results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File and Tooling Organisation\\n\\nOverview\\n\\n- thefactory-db is a PostgreSQL wrapper that provides FTS text search (tsvector) and vector similarity (pgvector) for hybrid search across two content models: Documents (text) and Entities (JSON).\\n- It is designed to be reusable across projects. You can depend on it as a local file dependency (\\\"thefactory-db\\\": \\\"file:../thefactory-db\\\") or publish it to a private registry.\\n- Database connection is provided via a Postgres connection string so multiple projects can access the same DB (ensure access strategy avoids concurrency hazards at the application layer).\\n\\nTop-level Layout\\n\\n- README.md: Quick-start usage and populate script instructions.\\n- package.json, tsconfig.json: Build and TypeScript configuration.\\n- src/: Source code for the database wrapper and types.\\n- docs/: Human-facing documentation for this package (this file).\\n  - docs/schema.sql: Canonical Postgres schema and function definitions for Documents and Entities.\\n  - docs/hybrid_search.sql: Reference hybrid search functions and examples for both tables, including filters by ids/types and JSON match.\\n\\nKey Source Modules (src/)\\n\\n- src/index.ts: Public entry point. Exports openDatabase(options) which returns a Database API instance. The instance provides:\\n  - Documents API (text content)\\n    - addDocument({ type, content, metadata? }): Promise<Document> — Inserts a document with embedding using the documents table.\\n    - getDocumentById(id: string): Promise<Document | undefined>\\n    - updateDocument(id: string, patch: Partial<DocumentInput>): Promise<Document | undefined>\\n    - deleteDocument(id: string): Promise<boolean>\\n    - searchDocuments({ query, textWeight?, limit?, ids?, types? }): Promise<DocumentWithScore[]> — Hybrid search over documents via hybrid_search_documents.\\n  - Entities API (json content)\\n    - addEntity({ type, content, metadata? }): Promise<Entity> — Inserts an entity with embedding. For tokens/embeddings, JSON values are stringified without keys/braces/colons to reduce noise.\\n    - getEntityById(id: string): Promise<Entity | undefined>\\n    - updateEntity(id: string, patch: Partial<EntityInput>): Promise<Entity | undefined>\\n    - deleteEntity(id: string): Promise<boolean>\\n    - searchEntities({ query, textWeight?, limit?, ids?, types? }): Promise<EntityWithScore[]> — Hybrid search over entities via hybrid_search_entities.\\n    - matchEntities({ match, limit?, ids?, types? }): Promise<Entity[]> — Returns entities whose JSON content contains the provided JSON structure (Postgres @> containment). Optional ids/types filters are supported.\\n  - raw(): pg.Client — Gives low-level access for advanced SQL.\\n\\n- src/types.ts: Shared TypeScript types for Documents and Entities, Search options and result row types, and OpenDbOptions.\\n- src/connection.ts: Connection factory and schema init. Loads SQL from docs/schema.sql and installs hybrid_search functions. Ensures pgvector extension is available.\\n\\nDatabase Schema\\n\\nTwo tables are maintained:\\n\\n- documents (text content)\\n  - id (uuid primary key, default gen_random_uuid())\\n  - type (text not null)\\n  - content (text not null)\\n  - fts (tsvector, generated from content)\\n  - embedding (vector(384))\\n  - created_at, updated_at (timestamptz, updated_at maintained via trigger)\\n  - metadata (jsonb)\\n\\n- entities (jsonb content)\\n  - id (uuid primary key, default gen_random_uuid())\\n  - type (text not null)\\n  - content (jsonb not null)\\n  - fts (tsvector, generated from JSON values only; keys and punctuation excluded)\\n  - embedding (vector(384))\\n  - created_at, updated_at (timestamptz, updated_at maintained via trigger)\\n  - metadata (jsonb)\\n\\nEmbedding dimension is 384 and requires the pgvector extension.\\n\\nHybrid Search\\n\\n- searchDocuments and searchEntities combine text rank (ts_rank_cd over tsvector using websearch_to_tsquery) and vector similarity (cosine distance) with a weight factor (textWeight in [0,1]). Filters (ids/types) are passed through as parameters.\\n- SQL reference implementations are provided in docs/hybrid_search.sql with:\\n  - hybrid_search_documents(query text, query_vec vector, text_weight real, max_results int, ids uuid[] default null, types text[] default null)\\n  - hybrid_search_entities(query text, query_vec vector, text_weight real, max_results int, ids uuid[] default null, types text[] default null)\\n- JSON match utility for entities:\\n  - match_entities(match jsonb, max_results int default 50, ids uuid[] default null, types text[] default null)\\n\\nScripts (scripts/)\\n\\n- scripts/populate.ts: CLI tool to scan a project and ingest into the DB, then run a sample hybrid search.\\n  - Flags:\\n    - --root <path> (default: cwd) Project root to scan\\n    - --url <postgres-url> (default: DATABASE_URL or localhost)\\n    - --textWeight <0..1> (default: 0.6) Weight for text vs vector\\n    - --reset (boolean) TRUNCATE entities/documents\\n\\nBreaking Changes\\n\\n- The previous single \\\"entities\\\" table that stored text content is now split:\\n  - The old behavior maps to the new documents table (text content).\\n  - A new entities table now stores JSON content and supports JSON containment matching via matchEntities.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n- Required extensions: pgcrypto and pgvector are created in docs/schema.sql.\\n- Vector dimension is 384.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",
