Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Implement Core Model and Service for Blueprints (ID: 2e73dab8-10bb-4908-a3de-a7090c4fbd4d)\n##DESCRIPTION: Define the data model for 'Blueprints', which act as templates or schemas for knowledge within an Area. A Blueprint should define required properties and relationships for a type of entity. Update `graph_service.py` to manage `Blueprint` nodes and their association with `Area` nodes via an `APPLIES_TO` relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create Test Scenario for a Property Purchasing Knowledge Graph (ID: 346cff1b-a052-422f-9e9c-e2bb8a694f92)\n##DESCRIPTION: Develop a test suite under `tests/scenarios/test_property_purchase.py`. This test will establish a 'Property' Area, define a Blueprint for what constitutes a property listing, ingest sample data for properties in a specific location, and confirm that the system can retrieve relevant, structured information based on user-like queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.
