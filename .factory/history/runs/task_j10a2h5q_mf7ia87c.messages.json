    "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 2cd244ee-c255-487c-882c-c28cd857156e)\n##TITLE:\nPreparing for online mode\n##DESCRIPTION:\nUp until now everything was running locally, but we would like to introduce other clients to work together on a project. The common ground where all project data would be located is a git repository.\nSo there needs to be a backend that would allow for clients to do everything this app does (manipulate projects/tasks/features) and launch agents on them.\nThis means we also need to have a service for running agents as part of the backend (could be a micro-service that the main backend relays to).\n\nOne important requirement is that a client (like this one) might still want to run everything locally without touching the backend. It must still be possible to do so, which means that all project related data lives in the repository, apart from big blob data. Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one. Not as a package, because the backend isn't a library. They might have shared code - in which case, we have to create yet another project for the shared library code.\nThe initial backend task will be in this project, and once it's running we will migrate to have a task for further features in its project and another task here for further improving this app's usage of it.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Online Mode Architecture and Repository Plan (ID: 7c431bc6-d88f-4e8b-be9e-496e40e2bf08)\n##DESCRIPTION: Define the high-level architecture for introducing online mode: 1) a new backend service repository (a Nest.js project serving REST+WebSocket), 2) an agent runner micro-service (separate process, same repo or sibling), and 3) a shared library repository for protocol types and reusable logic. Deliverables: an ARCHITECTURE.md in docs/ describing components, data flow, service boundaries, Git-as-source-of-truth model, and offline-first requirements; a plan for repository creation (names, tech stacks, initial scaffolds), and how this app will select between local and backend modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON.

This file will define the high-level architecture for the new online mode, including the backend service, agent runner, shared library, and how the existing client will integrate with them.

The core idea is to introduce a backend system that orchestrates project state and agent execution, using a Git repository as the single source of truth for project data.\\n\\n## 1. Guiding Principles\\n\\n- **Git as the Source of Truth**: All project data (tasks, features, code) is stored in a Git repository. The backend and clients clone and interact with this repository. This simplifies data synchronization and allows developers to use standard Git workflows.\\n- **Offline-First Client**: The existing Electron application must remain fully functional in a local-only (offline) mode. The online mode is an enhancement, not a replacement.\\n- **Service-Based Architecture**: The backend is split into a primary service for API/WebSocket communication and a separate service for executing agents. This separation allows for independent scaling and resource management of agent execution.\\n- **Shared Protocol**: A shared library will define the data structures and types for communication between the client and backend, ensuring type safety and consistency.\\n\\n## 2. System Components\\n\\nThe online mode consists of three main components, distributed across separate repositories.\\n\\n### a. Dev-Agent Backend\\n\\n- **Description**: A Nest.js application that serves as the main entry point for clients. It manages access to projects (Git repositories), handles user authentication (future), and orchestrates agent runs.\\n- **Responsibilities**:\\n    - Exposing a REST API for project management (e.g., listing projects, viewing tasks/features).\\n    - Providing a WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates (e.g., agent progress, file changes).\\n    - Authenticating users and authorizing access to repositories.\\n    - Delegating agent execution requests to the Agent Runner service.\\n    - Caching and indexing repository data for performance (e.g., using a local database).\\n- **Technology Stack**:\\n    - **Framework**: Nest.js (TypeScript)\\n    - **Communication**: REST, WebSockets\\n\\n### b. Dev-Agent Runner\\n\\n- **Description**: A micro-service responsible for executing agent tasks. It receives a job from the backend, clones the specified project repository, runs the agent using the `factory-ts` library, and streams progress back to the backend.\\n- **Responsibilities**:\\n    - Managing a queue of agent execution jobs.\\n    - Isolating agent runs in secure, temporary environments (e.g., Docker containers).\\n    - Cloning the correct version of the project repository.\\n    - Executing the agent and capturing logs, file changes, and status updates.\\n    - Pushing resulting code changes back to the Git repository.\\n    - Streaming real-time updates via the backend's WebSocket.\\n- **Deployment**: Can be deployed as a separate process or container, potentially on different infrastructure optimized for compute tasks. It can be part of the backend repository for simplicity to start.\\n\\n### c. Dev-Agent Shared Library\\n\\n- **Description**: An NPM package containing shared code, primarily TypeScript types and interfaces, for communication between the backend and the client.\\n- **Responsibilities**:\\n    - Defining the data transfer objects (DTOs) for REST API and WebSocket payloads.\\n    - Containing reusable validation logic or constants.\\n- **Technology Stack**:\\n    - **Language**: TypeScript\\n    - **Package Manager**: NPM/Yarn\\n\\n### d. Dev-Agent Client (This Application)\\n\\n- **Description**: The existing Electron application, which will be updated to act as a client to the backend services.\\n- **Responsibilities**:\\n    - A new \\\"mode selection\\\" interface (Local vs. Online).\\n    - In \\\"Online Mode\\\":\\n        - Authenticating with the backend.\\n        - Fetching project lists and data from the backend API.\\n        - Subscribing to WebSocket for real-time updates.\\n        - Sending requests to the backend to run agents.\\n        - Displaying read-only views of agent progress while the backend runs them.\\n    - In \\\"Local Mode\\\":\\n        - The application functions as it does today, directly interacting with the local filesystem and running agents in a local process.\\n\\n## 3. Repository & Project Plan\\n\\nWe will create two new repositories alongside the existing `dev-agent` repository.\\n\\n| Repository Name       | Description                                  | Tech Stack              | Initial Scaffolding Plan                                                              |\\n| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `dev-agent-backend`   | Backend service and Agent Runner microservice. | Nest.js, TypeScript     | 1. Initialize a new Nest.js project. 2. Define modules for `Project`, `Auth`, `Agent`. 3. Set up REST and WebSocket gateways. 4. Create a separate module/entrypoint for the Agent Runner. |\\n| `dev-agent-shared`    | Shared types and interfaces.                 | TypeScript, NPM         | 1. Initialize a new TypeScript project. 2. Define initial interfaces for `Project`, `Task`, `Feature`, `AgentRun`. 3. Publish as a private NPM package. |\\n| `dev-agent` (existing) | The Electron client application.             | Electron, React, TS     | 1. Add `dev-agent-shared` as a dependency. 2. Implement a service layer to communicate with the backend. 3. Create UI for mode selection and online project browsing. |\\n\\n## 4. Architecture and Data Flow\\n\\nThe system is designed around Git as the central point of coordination.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\n    subgraph Client App\\n        A[UI Components]\\n    end\\n\\n    subgraph Backend Infrastructure\\n        B[Backend Service - Nest.js]\\n        C[Agent Runner Service]\\n    end\\n\\n    subgraph External\\n        D[Git Repository]\\n        E[LLM APIs]\\n    end\\n\\n    A -- REST/WebSocket --> B\\n    B -- Job Request --> C\\n    C -- Clones/Pulls --> D\\n    C -- Executes Agent --> E\\n    C -- Pushes Changes --> D\\n    B -- Notifies Client --> A\\n    B -- Fetches Data --> D\\n```\\n\\n**Data Flow for an Agent Run:**\\n\\n1.  **Client -> Backend**: The user in the client app requests to run an agent on a feature. A request is sent to the Backend's REST API.\\n2.  **Backend -> Agent Runner**: The Backend validates the request and sends a job to the Agent Runner service. The job contains the Git repository URL, the commit/branch to work on, and the agent task details.\\n3.  **Agent Runner -> Git Repo**: The Agent Runner clones the repository.\\n4.  **Agent Runner -> LLM**: The Agent Runner executes the agent logic (using `factory-ts`), which involves making calls to LLM APIs.\\n5.  **Agent Runner -> Backend**: Progress, logs, and status are streamed back to the Backend, which forwards them to the client via WebSocket.\\n6.  **Agent Runner -> Git Repo**: Upon successful completion, the Agent Runner commits and pushes the changes to the Git repository.\\n7.  **Backend -> Client**: The Backend sends a final completion status to the Client.\\n\\n## 5. Client Mode Selection (Local vs. Online)\\n\\nThe client will need a mechanism to switch between modes.\\n\\n- **Initial Setup**: On first launch, or from a settings page, the user can configure the application mode.\\n- **Configuration**: The choice will be stored in a local configuration file. This configuration will include the backend URL if \\\"Online Mode\\\" is selected.\\n- **Implementation**: A new service layer/module will be introduced in the client. This layer will abstract the data source.\\n    - When in **Local Mode**, it will use the existing `factory-ts` and file system integrations directly.\\n    - When in **Online Mode**, it will make API calls to the backend and will not interact with `factory-ts` locally for agent runs.\\n- **UI Changes**:\\n    - The project list will be populated from the local file system (Local) or a backend API call (Online).\\n    - The \\\"Run Agent\\\" button will either trigger a local process or a backend API call depending on the mode.\\n    - A status indicator in the UI should make it clear which mode is currently active.\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"finish_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Each task is stored in its own file, named with its unique ID.\\n\\n**Schema:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"id\\\": \\\"uuid\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'done' | 'rejected'\\\",\\n  \\\"features\\\": [\\n    \\\"feature-id-1\\\",\\n    \\\"feature-id-2\\\"\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"id\\\": \\\"tsk-f9b3e1a2-c7d6-4a5b-8e1d-9f0c3a8b4e5d\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Implement User Authentication\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"Set up the complete authentication flow, including sign-up, login, and logout.\\\",\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"in_progress\\\",\\n  \\\"features\\\": [\\n    \\\"feat-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d\\\"\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3.3. Feature (`features/{feature-id}.json`)\\n\\nFeatures are concrete, implementable units of work that belong to a single task.\\n\\n**Schema:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"id\\\": \\\"uuid\\\",\\n  \\\"task_id\\\": \\\"uuid\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'review' | 'done' | 'rejected'\\\",\\n  \\\"rejection_reason\\\": \\\"string | null\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"id\\\": \\\"feat-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d\\\",\\n  \\\"task_id\\\": \\\"tsk-f9b3e1a2-c7d6-4a5b-8e1d-9f0c3a8b4e5d\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Create Login API Endpoint\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"Develop a REST API endpoint for user login with email and password.\\\",\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"todo\\\",\\n  \\\"rejection_reason\\\": null\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3.4.

Handling Large Files (Big Blobs)\\n\\nLarge binary assets (e.g., images, datasets, compiled artifacts) should not be committed directly to the Git repository. Instead, they are stored externally, and the repository contains lightweight \\\"pointer files.\\\"\\n\\n[Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is the recommended tool for this purpose. When Git LFS is not feasible, a manual pointer file convention can be used.\\n\\n**Pointer File Convention (`{original-filename}.ptr.json`):**\\n\\nA pointer file is a JSON file that references a file in an external blob store (like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.).\\n\\n**Schema:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"schema_version\\\": \\\"1.0\\\",\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"blob-pointer\\\",\\n  \\\"storage_provider\\\": \\\"string\\\", // e.g., \\\"s3\\\", \\\"gcs\\\"\\n  \\\"uri\\\": \\\"string\\\",             // The full URI to access the blob\\n  \\\"size_bytes\\\": \\\"number\\\",\\n  \\\"sha256\\\": \\\"string\\\"           // SHA256 hash of the file content\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Example (`assets/logo.png.ptr.json`):**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"schema_version\\\": \\\"1.0\\\",\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"blob-pointer\\\",\\n  \\\"storage_provider\\\": \\\"s3\\\",\\n  \\\"uri\\\": \\\"s3://my-project-assets/images/logo.png\\\",\\n  \\\"size_bytes\\\": 152048,\\n  \\\"sha256\\\": \\\"c137a5651f524e41f2394639918c5e665123d4c06e8c8959c9b3f3a8b7e2b8d4\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## 5. Git Conventions\\n\\nTo ensure traceability and prevent conflicts, all automated changes made by agents must follow strict Git conventions.\\n\\n### 5.1. Branching Strategy\\n\\n- **`main` / `master`**: This is the primary stable branch. It should always be in a deployable state. Direct commits are discouraged.\\n- **`feature/{feature-id}`**: All work on a feature is done in a dedicated branch named after the feature's ID. This isolates work, simplifies code reviews, and allows for parallel development. An agent starts its work by creating a branch with this naming scheme from an up-to-date `main` branch.\\n\\n### 5.2. Commit Messages\\n\\nAutomated commits made by agents must be deterministic and information-rich. They should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.\\n\\n**Format:**\\n```\\n<type>(<scope>): <subject>\\n\\n[optional body]\\n\\n[optional footer(s)]\\n```\\n\\n**Recommended Structure for Agent Commits:**\\n\\n```\\nfeat(agent): Implement user login API\\n\\nThis commit introduces the /api/login endpoint and integrates the\\nauthentication service.\\n\\nAgent: agent-dev-007\\nFeature-ID: feat-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d\\nRun-ID: run-b9e8c7d6-f5a4-3b2c-1d0e-9f8a7b6c5d4e\\n```\\n\\n- **Type**: `feat` for new features, `fix` for bug fixes, `chore` for maintenance.\\n- **Scope**: `agent` is a good default for automated changes.\\n- **Footer Metadata**: Includes machine-readable identifiers to link the commit back to the project management data.\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"finish_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The common ground where all project data would be located is a git repository.\nSo there needs to be a backend that would allow for clients to do everything this app does (manipulate projects/tasks/features) and launch agents on them.\nThis means we also need to have a service for running agents as part of the backend (could be a micro-service that the main backend relays to).\n\nOne important requirement is that a client (like this one) might still want to run everything locally without touching the backend.

Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one.

The goal is to provide a secure and flexible system that allows clients (both local and remote) to interact with project data stored in Git repositories via the backend.\\n\\n## 1. Client Authentication\\n\\nClients will authenticate with the backend using a token-based system.\\n\\n### 1.1. Token Mechanism\\n\\n-   **Type**: Personal Access Tokens (PATs) will be issued to clients (e.g., the desktop app, CLI tools).\\n-   **Format**: Tokens will be secure, random strings with a prefix for identifiability.\\n-   **Transport**: Clients must send the token in the `Authorization` HTTP header with the `Bearer` scheme on every API request.\\n\\n    ```\\n    Authorization: Bearer <your-personal-access-token>\\n    ```\\n\\n### 1.2. Token Lifecycle\\n\\n-   **Issuance**: Users will generate tokens through a secure backend endpoint or UI (to be built).\\n-   **Permissions/Scopes**: Tokens can be scoped with permissions (e.g., `read:projects`, `run:agents`) to limit their capabilities. For the MVP, a single scope for full access is sufficient.\\n-   **Revocation**: Users must be able to revoke tokens at any time.\\n-   **Storage**: Clients are responsible for securely storing their tokens.\\n\\n## 2. Repository Access Strategy\\n\\nThe backend needs to access Git repositories on behalf of users to manage project data. The core principle is that the backend holds credentials for each project repository it manages.\\n\\n### 2.1. Credential Model\\n\\n-   **Per-Project Credentials**: Access to each Git repository is managed independently. The backend will store a dedicated credential (SSH key or access token) for each repository.\\n-   **Mechanism**: SSH Deploy Keys are the preferred method. They can be configured with read-only or read-write access directly on the Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).\\n    -   **Read-Write Keys**: Required for the backend to push changes (e.g., updating tasks, features).\\n    -   **Fine-grained Tokens**: As an alternative, Git provider tokens (like GitHub's Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens) can be used if they can be scoped to a single repository.\\n\\n### 2.2. Credential Storage and Security\\n\\n-   **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive credentials (SSH private keys, tokens) **MUST** be encrypted at rest in the backend's database or a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS).\\n-   **Access Control**: The backend service must have strict internal controls to ensure credentials are only ever decrypted in memory just-in-time for a Git operation.\\n-   **Rotation**: A mechanism for rotating credentials should be implemented. For deploy keys, this means generating a new keypair, updating the Git provider, and replacing the key in the backend's storage.\\n\\n### 2.3. Injecting Credentials for Git Processes\\n\\nThe backend will shell out to the `git` CLI for repository operations. Credentials will be injected securely:\\n\\n-   **For SSH**: The private key will be written to a temporary file with strict permissions (`0600`). The `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variable will be used to point `git` to this key.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    export GIT_SSH_COMMAND=\\\"ssh -i /path/to/temp/private_key -o IdentitiesOnly=yes\\\"\\n    git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git\\n    # Securely delete the temporary key file immediately after the operation\\n    ```\\n\\n-   **For HTTPS**: If using tokens, they can be embedded in the remote URL. This is less secure as the token might be logged. A better approach is to use a Git credential helper configured on-the-fly for the specific process.\\n\\n## 3. Roles and Permissions (MVP)\\n\\nUser permissions are defined at the project level.\\n\\n-   **Reader**: Can view project details, tasks, and features. Has read-only (clone/pull) access to the repository via the backend.\\n-   **Editor**: All `Reader` permissions, plus the ability to create and modify projects, tasks, and features. Requires read-write (push) access to the repository.\\n-   **Runner**: All `Editor` permissions, plus the ability to launch agent runs on a project.\\n\\n## 4. Sequence Diagrams\\n\\n### 4.1. Client API Request\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Client\\n    participant Backend API\\n\\n    Client->>Backend API: POST /api/v1/features (Authorization: Bearer <token>)\\n    Backend API-->>Backend API: Verify Bearer Token\\n    alt Token Valid\\n        Backend API->>Backend API: Process Request\\n        Backend API-->>Client: 201 Created\\n    else Token Invalid\\n        Backend API-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized\\n    end\\n```\\n\\n### 4.2.

Security Considerations\\n\\n-   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Deploy keys and tokens **MUST** be scoped to the single repository they are for. Avoid using user-level credentials.\\n-   **Credential Leakage**: Ensure that raw credentials or sensitive file paths are never logged or exposed in API responses or agent run outputs.\\n-   **Transport Security**: All communication between clients and the backend, and between the backend and Git providers, **MUST** use TLS (HTTPS/SSH).\\n-   **Input Sanitization**: The backend must sanitize all inputs, especially repository URLs, to prevent command injection attacks when interacting with `git`.\\n-   **Auditing**: All actions, especially those involving repository access or modification, should be logged for security auditing.\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"finish_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The final output should be a markdown file `docs/shared_library_plan.md` containing this plan and a proposal for the package structure.\\n\\nFirst, I will draft the content for the `docs/shared_library_plan.md` file.

I will also specify the use of Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to manage changes.\\n\\nFinally, the plan will include an integration section explaining how both the backend and frontend will consume this shared package, along with a proposed development workflow for making changes to the library.\\n\\nOnce the content is finalized, I will use the `write_file` tool to create `docs/shared_library_plan.md`. Since the task asks for a plan and a structure proposal, and my plan includes the structure proposal, creating this document will fulfill all the requirements. After writing the file, I will use `finish_feature` to mark the task as complete.\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"filename\": \"docs/shared_library_plan.md\",\n        \"content\": \"# Shared Library Plan\\n\\nThis document outlines the plan for a shared library to be used by the backend and frontend clients. The purpose of this library is to ensure consistency, reduce code duplication, and provide a single source of truth for data structures and protocols.\\n\\n## 1. Library Contents\\n\\nThe shared library will be an npm package containing the following:\\n\\n### 1.1. TypeScript API Models\\n\\n- **Source**: Automatically generated from an OpenAPI 3.0 specification file (`openapi.yaml`) which will be maintained in the shared library's repository.\\n- **Generation**: We will use a tool like `openapi-typescript` to convert the OpenAPI spec into TypeScript interfaces.\\n- **Purpose**: To provide strongly-typed interfaces for all API requests and responses, enabling type safety and autocompletion in both the backend and frontend.\\n\\n### 1.2. JSON Schemas\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To define the structure of data files stored within the project's git repository, such as `project.json` or `task.json`.\\n- **Usage**: These schemas will be used for validation on the client-side (before committing) and server-side (when processing data). This ensures data integrity.\\n- **Location**: They will be stored as `.schema.json` files within the library.\\n\\n### 1.3. Common Utilities\\n\\n- **Purpose**: A set of common functions needed by both client and server to handle project data consistently.\\n- **Examples**:\\n    - `contentHashing`: A function to generate a consistent hash of file contents (e.g., using SHA-256).\\n    - `commitMetadata`: Helper functions to embed and parse metadata within Git commit messages, which can be used for agent communication or tracking.\\n    - Other shared logic as identified during development.\\n\\n## 2. Repository and Package Structure\\n\\nThe library will live in its own dedicated Git repository. It will be set up as a standard TypeScript project and published as an npm package.\\n\\n### Proposed Directory Structure:\\n\\n```\\nproject-shared/\\n├── .github/\\n│   └── workflows/\\n│       └── publish.yml       # CI/CD for publishing to registry\\n├── openapi/\\n│   └── spec.yaml             # Single source of truth for the API\\n├── src/\\n│   ├── schemas/\\n│   │   ├── project.schema.json\\n│   │   └── task.schema.json\\n│   ├── types/\\n│   │   └── api.ts              # Generated from openapi/spec.yaml\\n│   ├── utils/\\n│   │   ├── hashing.ts\\n│   │   └── commit.ts\\n│   └── index.ts                # Main export file for the package\\n├── package.json\\n├── tsconfig.json\\n└── README.md\\n```\\n\\n## 3. Publishing and Versioning\\n\\n### 3.1. Publishing Strategy\\n\\nWe recommend publishing the library as a private package to **GitHub Packages**.\\n\\n- **Rationale**:\\n    - It integrates well with GitHub repositories.\\n    - It's free for private repositories within an organization.\\n    - It provides a robust, standard way to manage package dependencies compared to using Git tags, which can be less reliable for dependency management.\\n\\nA CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) will be set up to automatically publish a new version to GitHub Packages whenever a new tag is pushed to the `main` branch.\\n\\n### 3.2. Versioning\\n\\nThe package will follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.\\n\\n- **MAJOR** version change for incompatible API changes (e.g., breaking changes in API models or JSON schemas).\\n- **MINOR** version change for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner (e.g., adding a new utility or an optional API field).\\n- **PATCH** version change for backward-compatible bug fixes.\\n\\n## 4. Integration Plan\\n\\n### 4.1. Backend Integration\\n\\n1.  Add the shared package as a dependency in the backend's `package.json`.\\n2.  Import types from `@<scope>/project-shared` for request handlers, response objects, and service layers.\\n3.  Use JSON schemas to validate incoming data and data read from repositories.\\n4.  Use utility functions for consistent operations like hashing.\\n\\n### 4.2. Frontend (Client) Integration\\n\\n1.  Add the shared package as a dependency in the client's `package.json`.\\n2.  Import types for the API client/service layer to ensure calls to the backend are type-safe.\\n3.  Use JSON schemas for client-side validation of project files before they are saved or committed.\\n4.  Use utility functions where needed.\\n\\n## 5. Development Workflow\\n\\n1.  **Change Required**: A developer identifies a need for a change in a shared component (e.g., a new API endpoint).\\n2.  **Update Spec**: The `openapi/spec.yaml` in the shared library repository is updated first.\\n3.  **Generate Types**: The developer runs a script (e.g., `npm run generate:types`) to update the TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/`.\\n4.  **Implement Changes**: Any other necessary changes (schemas, utils) are made.\\n5.  **Pull Request**: A PR is created, reviewed, and merged into the `main` branch of the shared library repository.\\n6.  **Publish**: A new version number is determined based on SemVer, a Git tag is created, and the new version is published to GitHub Packages (this can be automated).\\n7.  **Update Consumers**: The backend and frontend projects are updated to use the new version of the shared package.\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"finish_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`.

The common ground where all project data would be located is a git repository.\nSo there needs to be a backend that would allow for clients to do everything this app does (manipulate projects/tasks/features) and launch agents on them.\nThis means we also need to have a service for running agents as part of the backend (could be a micro-service that the main backend relays to).\n\nOne important requirement is that a client (like this one) might still want to run everything locally without touching the backend. It must still be possible to do so, which means that all project related data lives in the repository, apart from big blob data. Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one. Not as a package, because the backend isn't a library. They might have shared code - in which case, we have to create yet another project for the shared library code.\nThe initial backend task will be in this project, and once it's running we will migrate to have a task for further features in its project and another task here for further improving this app's usage of it.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Agent Runner Service Design (ID: cf26e479-dbb5-45f1-a03e-ab849e5eb1b4)\n##DESCRIPTION: Define a dedicated micro-service (or module) responsible for running agents as jobs: queue semantics, concurrency limits, job lifecycle, logging, and artifact handling mapped to Git commits when relevant. Specify how it integrates with factory-ts (or refactored shared library) and how it receives tasks from the main backend via RPC/HTTP or message queue. Output: docs/agent_runner/OVERVIEW.md with API and event contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step.

Overview\\n\\nThe Agent Runner Service is a core component of the backend architecture. Its primary responsibility is to manage the lifecycle of \\\"agent jobs.\\\" An agent job represents the execution of a specific agent (e.g., \\\"Developer Agent\\\") on a given task within a Git repository.\\n\\nThe service operates on a job queue, ensuring that tasks are processed reliably. It interacts with Git repositories to fetch the context for a task and to commit the results of the agent's work.\\n\\nKey Responsibilities:\\n- Manage a queue of agent jobs.\\n- Execute agents using a shared library (derived from `factory-ts`).\\n- Handle the entire lifecycle of a job, from queuing to completion or failure.\\n- Interact with Git repositories to check out code and commit results.\\n- Provide detailed logging and status updates for each job.\\n- Handle artifacts generated by agents and commit them back to the repository.\\n\\n## 2. Architecture\\n\\nThe Agent Runner is designed as a standalone micro-service. It communicates with the main backend service, which acts as the primary interface for clients.\\n\\n- **Communication**: The main backend and the Agent Runner communicate via a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis Streams) for job submission and event notifications. This provides a robust, asynchronous, and scalable integration pattern. An auxiliary REST API on the Agent Runner can be used for direct queries (e.g., getting job status).\\n\\n- **Core Logic**: The service will use a shared library, refactored from the existing `factory-ts` package, to orchestrate agent runs. This ensures that agents behave consistently whether run locally by a client or remotely via the backend.\\n\\n- **Environment**: Each job is executed in an isolated environment (e.g., a temporary directory or a container) with a fresh clone of the specified Git repository.\\n\\n## 3. Job Lifecycle\\n\\nA job progresses through a well-defined set of states:\\n\\n1.  **`queued`**: The job has been received and is waiting for a worker to become available.\\n2.  **`running`**: A worker has picked up the job and is executing the agent. The service will clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the agent.\\n3.  **`completed`**: The agent finished its work successfully. Any file changes have been committed to the repository.\\n4.  **`failed`**: The agent execution failed due to an error. The error details are logged and reported.\\n5.  **`cancelled`**: The job was cancelled by a user request before it could be completed.\\n\\n## 4. Job Queue and Concurrency\\n\\n- **Queue**: Jobs are submitted by the main backend to a dedicated message queue topic (e.g., `agent.jobs.new`).\\n- **Workers**: The Agent Runner service will run a pool of workers that listen to this queue.\\n- **Concurrency**: The number of concurrent jobs is determined by the number of active workers. This can be configured and scaled horizontally by deploying more instances of the Agent Runner service.\\n- **Prioritization**: (Future) The queue can be configured to support different priority levels for jobs.\\n\\n## 5. API and Event Contracts\\n\\nCommunication is primarily event-driven, with an optional REST API for synchronous queries.\\n\\n### 5.1. Job Submission (Message Queue)\\n\\nThe main backend enqueues a job by sending a message to the `agent.jobs.new` topic.\\n\\n**Message Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"jobId\\\": \\\"uuid-v4-string\\\",\\n  \\\"repository\\\": {\\n    \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/user/repo.git\\\",\\n    \\\"branch\\\": \\\"main\\\",\\n    \\\"commit\\\": \\\"optional-specific-commit-sha\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"agent\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"DeveloperAgent\\\",\\n    \\\"version\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"task\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"task-uuid\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"Implement the login feature.\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"feature\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"feature-uuid\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"As a user, I want to log in.\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"userId\\\": \\\"user-uuid\\\",\\n    \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"iso-8601-timestamp\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 5.2. Event Notifications (Message Queue)\\n\\nThe Agent Runner publishes events to a notification topic (e.g., `agent.jobs.events`) that the main backend subscribes to.\\n\\n**Event: `job.status.changed`**\\nThis event is sent for every state transition in the job lifecycle.\\n\\n**Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"jobId\\\": \\\"uuid-v4-string\\\",\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"queued|running|completed|failed|cancelled\\\",\\n  \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"iso-8601-timestamp\\\",\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    // Optional data depending on status\\n    \\\"commit\\\": \\\"new-commit-sha-on-completion\\\", // for 'completed'\\n    \\\"error\\\": \\\"Error message and stack trace\\\", // for 'failed'\\n    \\\"reason\\\": \\\"Cancelled by user\\\" // for 'cancelled'\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Event: `job.log.created`**\\nThis event is for streaming agent logs/output back to the main backend.\\n\\n**Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"jobId\\\": \\\"uuid-v4-string\\\",\\n  \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"iso-8601-timestamp\\\",\\n  \\\"stream\\\": \\\"stdout|stderr\\\",\\n  \\\"message\\\": \\\"Log line from the agent.\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 5.3. REST API (Optional)\\n\\nThe Agent Runner can expose a simple REST API for direct status checks.\\n\\n- `GET /jobs/{jobId}`\\n  - **Description**: Get the current status and history of a job.\\n  - **Response**:\\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \\\"jobId\\\": \\\"uuid-v4-string\\\",\\n      \\\"status\\\": \\\"running\\\",\\n      \\\"history\\\": [\\n        { \\\"status\\\": \\\"queued\\\", \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"...\\\" },\\n        { \\\"status\\\": \\\"running\\\", \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"...\\\" }\\n      ],\\n      \\\"agent\\\": { \\\"id\\\": \\\"DeveloperAgent\\\" },\\n      \\\"task\\\": { \\\"id\\\": \\\"task-uuid\\\" }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n- `POST /jobs/{jobId}/cancel`\\n  - **Description**: Request cancellation of a job.\\n  - **Response**: `202 Accepted`\\n\\n## 6. Artifact Handling\\n\\n1.  **Clone**: For each job, the service performs a fresh clone of the specified repository and branch.\\n2.  **Execution**: The agent runs within the context of this cloned repository.\\n3.  **Commit**: Upon successful completion, the agent is expected to have staged its changes using `git add`. The service is responsible for creating a commit with a standardized message.\\n    - **Commit Message Format**: `feat(agent): Implement feature 'feature-uuid' for task 'task-uuid'\\\\n\\\\nAgent: DeveloperAgent\\\\nJob: 'job-uuid'`\\n4.  **Push**: The service pushes the new commit(s) to the repository's branch.\\n5.  **Reporting**: The final commit SHA is reported back in the `job.status.changed` event for the `completed` state.\\n\\n## 7. Integration with `factory-ts` (Shared Library)\\n\\n- The core agent orchestration logic from `factory-ts` will be extracted into a shared library, consumable as an NPM package.\\n- The Agent Runner service will be a primary consumer of this library.\\n- The library will be responsible for:\\n  - Instantiating the correct agent.\\n  - Managing the agent's interaction with the filesystem and external tools (LLMs).\\n  - Providing hooks for logging and progress reporting that the Agent Runner will use to publish events.\\n\\nThis design ensures that agent logic is decoupled from the execution environment (local client vs. cloud service) and can be reused consistently.\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"finish_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one. Not as a package, because the backend isn't a library. They might have shared code - in which case, we have to create yet another project for the shared library code.\nThe initial backend task will be in this project, and once it's running we will migrate to have a task for further features in its project and another task here for further improving this app's usage of it.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Backend MVP Scaffolding and Repository Initialization (ID: bd6fb615-0fee-4724-9393-acb086d4fb17)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create a new backend repository structure proposal (Node/Express/Koa/Fastify recommended) with modules for auth, projects (git client), tasks/features (file IO), runs (runner client), and websocket gateway for streaming events. Include config management, logging, and testing setup. Output: docs/backend_repo_structure.md in this project and scripts/notes for bootstrapping the new repo (folder layout, packages, lint/test).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object.

This might be a gRPC or REST client.\\n-   **`storage/`**: Abstracts file system operations for tasks and features.\\n\\n### `src/gateways`\\n-   **Purpose:** Manages real-time communication with clients using WebSockets.\\n-   **`event.gateway.js`**: A single gateway to stream events related to agent runs, project updates, etc., to connected clients. It will use a library like `socket.io` or `ws`.\\n\\n### `src/middleware`\\n-   **Purpose:** Custom Express middleware for tasks like request logging, authentication checks, error handling, etc.\\n\\n### `config`\\n-   **Purpose:** Manages application configuration for different environments (development, staging, production). Libraries like `dotenv` and `convict` could be used.\\n\\n### `test`\\n-   **Purpose:** Contains all automated tests. The structure mirrors the `src/` directory.\\n-   **Technology:** Jest will be used as the test runner, with `supertest` for API endpoint testing.\\n\\n### Logging\\n-   A robust logging library like `winston` or `pino` will be integrated for structured, level-based logging. A logging utility will be placed in `src/utils`.\\n\\n## Shared Library\\n- If significant code needs to be shared between this backend and the Electron client (e.g., data models, validation schemas), it should be extracted into a separate private NPM package and consumed by both projects.\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"filename\": \"scripts/notes/bootstrap_backend.md\",\n        \"content\": \"# Backend Project Bootstrapping\\n\\nThis guide contains the directory structure and commands to scaffold the new Node.js backend service.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n\\n1.

It needs to cover several aspects: the overall design, disk layout for caching repositories, locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions, the API interface with method signatures for other services to use, strategies for branching and conflict resolution, policies for retries and timeouts, and security considerations. I have a clear plan for the structure and content of this document, so I will proceed with writing the file.\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"write_file\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"filename\": \"docs/backend_git_module.md\",\n        \"content\": \"# Backend Git Module Specification\\n\\n## 1. Overview\\n\\nThis document specifies the design for a backend module responsible for all git operations. This module will act as a safe wrapper around git, providing a clear interface for other backend services to interact with project repositories. It will manage local caches of git repositories, handle concurrency, and define strategies for branching, committing, and conflict resolution.\\n\\n## 2. Disk Layout and Caching\\n\\nTo manage repositories efficiently and support concurrent operations, a specific disk layout will be used.\\n\\n-   **Base Cache Directory**: A configurable base directory on the backend server (e.g., `/var/app/repo-cache/`).\\n-   **Repository Cache Structure**: Each repository will be cloned into a subdirectory named after a unique project identifier.\\n    -   `/<base_cache_dir>/<project_id>/repo.git`: A bare clone of the remote repository. This serves as the local mirror and is updated from the remote. All reads and branch creations happen from here.\\n    -   `/<base_cache_dir>/<project_id>/worktrees/<operation_id>/`: Short-lived worktrees created from `repo.git` for specific mutating operations (e.g., applying changes for a feature). Using worktrees allows for parallel operations on different branches without cloning the whole repository multiple times.\\n-   **Locking**: To prevent race conditions during git operations on the same project's bare repository.\\n    -   A lock file (e.g., `.lock`) will be used within each project's cache directory (`/<base_cache_dir>/<project_id>/.lock`).\\n    -   Operations modifying the bare repo (like `fetch` or preparing a worktree) must acquire an exclusive lock.\\n    -   The locking mechanism must have timeouts to prevent deadlocks and should be managed by a library like `proper-lockfile`.\\n\\n## 3. Core Operations and Interfaces\\n\\nThe module will expose a `GitService` with the following methods. All methods are asynchronous and should be idempotent where possible.\\n\\n### 3.1. Repository Management\\n\\n-   `initializeRepository(projectId: string, remoteUrl: string): Promise<void>`\\n    -   Clones the repository from `remoteUrl` into the cache as a bare repository if it doesn't exist.\\n    -   Performs an initial fetch of all branches and tags.\\n-   `syncRepository(projectId: string): Promise<void>`\\n    -   Fetches updates from the remote repository for all branches (`git fetch --all`).\\n    -   Prunes remote branches that no longer exist.\\n    -   This should be called periodically by a background job and before any operation that needs the latest state.\\n\\n### 3.2. Branching Strategy\\n\\n-   **Main Branch**: A designated main branch (e.g., `main`) representing the stable state. Direct modifications by agents are disallowed.\\n-   **Feature Branches**: All automated work will be on feature branches.\\n    -   **Naming Convention**: `agent/<feature_id>/<short-description>`\\n-   `createFeatureBranch(projectId: string, featureId: string, baseBranch: string = 'main'): Promise<string>`\\n    -   Creates a new branch for a feature from the latest version of the `baseBranch` in the local cache.\\n    -   Returns the name of the new branch.\\n\\n### 3.3. File Operations\\n\\n-   `getFilesInBranch(projectId: string, branchName: string, path: string = '.'): Promise<string[]>`\\n    -   Lists files and directories in a given path on a specific branch.\\n-   `readFileInBranch(projectId: string, branchName: string, filePath: string): Promise<string | null>`\\n    -   Reads the content of a file from a specific branch. Returns `null` if the file doesn't exist.\\n-   `applyChanges(projectId: string, branchName: string, changes: FileChange[], commitMessage: string): Promise<CommitInfo>`\\n    -   **FileChange**: Interface `{ filePath: string, content: string | null }` (`null` content means deletion).\\n    -   **CommitInfo**: Interface `{ commitHash: string, branchName: string, remotePushed: boolean }`.\\n    -   **Logic**:\\n        1.  Acquire lock for the project repository.\\n        2.  Create a temporary worktree for the operation from `branchName`.\\n        3.  Apply file changes (create, update, delete) within the worktree.\\n        4.  Commit the changes with the provided message.\\n        5.  Push the branch to the remote origin.\\n        6.  Clean up the worktree.\\n        7.  Release the lock.\\n    -   Returns information about the commit.\\n\\n### 3.4. Merging and Conflict Resolution\\n\\n-   `mergeBranch(projectId: string, sourceBranch: string, targetBranch: string): Promise<MergeResult>`\\n    -   **MergeResult**: Interface `{ success: boolean, conflict: boolean, commitHash?: string }`\\n    -   Attempts to merge `sourceBranch` into `targetBranch`.\\n-   **Conflict Resolution Policy**:\\n    -   **Automated**: The system will use a standard merge strategy (e.g., `ort`). If the merge is clean, it will be pushed.\\n    -   **On Conflict**: If a merge conflict occurs, the operation will fail (`conflict: true`). The system **will not** attempt to automatically resolve content conflicts. The conflict must be flagged for human intervention.\\n\\n## 4. Background Synchronization\\n\\n-   A background job will periodically call `syncRepository` for all active projects to keep the local caches up-to-date.\\n-   The sync interval should be configurable (e.g., every 5 minutes).\\n-   This minimizes latency for user-initiated operations.\\n\\n## 5. Error Handling, Retries, and Timeouts\\n\\n-   **Retry Policy**: Network-related operations (`clone`, `fetch`, `push`) should implement an exponential backoff retry mechanism for transient errors (e.g., up to 3 retries with 1s, 2s, 4s delays).\\n-   **Timeouts**: All external git operations must have a configurable timeout (e.g., 5 minutes for `clone`, 1 minute for `push`) to prevent indefinite hangs.\\n-   **Error Types**: The service should throw distinct error types for different failure modes (e.g., `RepoNotFound`, `BranchNotFound`, `MergeConflict`, `NetworkError`).\\n\\n## 6. Security Considerations\\n\\n-   **Credentials**: Git credentials (SSH keys or tokens) must be managed securely, e.g., via a secrets management service like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.\\n-   **Command Injection**: All git operations must be executed through a safe library (e.g., `isomorphic-git`, `nodegit`) instead of constructing raw shell commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.\\n-   **Path Traversal**: Input parameters like `projectId`, `branchName`, and `filePath` must be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks on the file system.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"finish_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`.

The common ground where all project data would be located is a git repository.\nSo there needs to be a backend that would allow for clients to do everything this app does (manipulate projects/tasks/features) and launch agents on them.\nThis means we also need to have a service for running agents as part of the backend (could be a micro-service that the main backend relays to).\n\nOne important requirement is that a client (like this one) might still want to run everything locally without touching the backend. It must still be possible to do so, which means that all project related data lives in the repository, apart from big blob data. Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one. Not as a package, because the backend isn't a library. They might have shared code - in which case, we have to create yet another project for the shared library code.\nThe initial backend task will be in this project, and once it's running we will migrate to have a task for further features in its project and another task here for further improving this app's usage of it.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Agent Orchestration Abstraction for Backend (ID: eea79fc6-197c-4c23-a40f-3b3c07ff347f)\n##DESCRIPTION: Define a thin abstraction layer in the backend to initiate and monitor agent runs using the shared factory library.

Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object.

Configuration\\n\\nConfiguration will be managed via environment variables on the backend server. The orchestrator service will read these variables to configure the `factory-ts` instance.\\n\\n### 3.1. Environment Variables\\n\\n| Variable                 | Description                                                                 | Example                             |\\n| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\\n| `ORCHESTRATOR_GIT_USER`    | The Git username for committing results.                                    | `\\\"AI Agent\\\"`                        |\\n| `ORCHESTRATOR_GIT_EMAIL`   | The Git email for committing results.                                       | `\\\"agent@example.com\\\"`               |\\n| `ORCHESTRATOR_DATA_DIR`    | A temporary directory for cloning repositories.                             | `/tmp/agent_runs`                   |\\n| `OPENAI_API_KEY`         | API key for OpenAI models.                                                  | `sk-...`                            |\\n| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`      | API key for Anthropic models.                                               | `sk-ant-...`                        |\\n| `MODEL_PRICING_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to a JSON file defining model pricing. Defaults to factory settings. | `/app/config/model-pricing.json`    |\\n\\n### 3.2. Project-Specific Configuration\\n\\nAny configuration specific to a project (e.g., which model to use, agent settings) **must** reside within that project's repository. The backend is generic and does not store project-specific settings.\\n\\nThe `factory-ts` library is already designed to read configuration from `.aispec/config.json` within the repository. The backend orchestrator will rely on this mechanism.\\n\\n## 4. Model, Pricing, and History Management\\n\\n-   **Models**: The backend will be configured with API keys for various LLM providers. The `factory-ts` library will handle the logic of selecting the appropriate client based on the model requested in the project's config.\\n-   **Pricing**: The `factory-ts` library contains a pricing service. The backend can override the default pricing data by providing a path to a custom pricing file via the `MODEL_PRICING_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. This allows the backend operator to centrally manage and update pricing information.\\n-   **History**: Agent run history (prompts, responses, tool calls) is managed by `factory-ts`. It is responsible for logging this data into the appropriate files within the `.aispec/history` directory of the repository.\\n\\n## 5. Run Results Serialization\\n\\nUpon completion of an agent run, the orchestrator must ensure all outputs are serialized back to the repository.\\n\\n### 5.1. Outputs\\n\\nThe following artifacts will be generated or modified by a run:\\n\\n-   **Source Code**: Any modified or created source files.\\n-   **Logs**: A detailed log of the agent's execution, including thoughts, tool calls, and LLM interactions. This will be stored in `.aispec/history/{runId}.log`.\\n-   **State Files**: Updates to the project's task or feature files (e.g., `*.feature.md`).\\n\\n### 5.2. Git Workflow\\n\\n1.  **Start**: Before a run, the orchestrator pulls the latest changes from the remote repository.\\n2.  **Execution**: The agent performs its work on the local clone.\\n3.  **Completion**: After the run, the orchestrator performs the following Git operations:\\n    -   `git add .`\\n    -   `git commit -m \\\"feat: Agent run {runId} for feature {featureId}\\\"`\\n    -   `git push`\\n\\nThis ensures that every agent run is an atomic commit, providing a clear and auditable history.\\n\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Overview\\n\\nThe application will support two operational modes:\\n\\n*   **Local-only Mode**: All operations (project management, agent execution) are performed on the local filesystem using the embedded `factory-ts` library. This is the default and legacy mode.\\n*   **Online Mode**: Operations are routed to a remote backend service via a REST API. The client acts as a \\\"thin client,\\\" and the backend manages the project state and agent execution.\\n\\nA user should be able to switch between these modes. The choice of mode will be persisted.\\n\\n## 2. Settings Model and Persistence\\n\\nWe will introduce a new settings model to store the application's configuration. This will be stored in a user-specific configuration file (e.g., in the app's user data directory managed by Electron).\\n\\n```typescript\\n// src/main/services/settingsService.ts (conceptual)\\ninterface AppSettings {\\n  mode: 'local' | 'online';\\n  backend: {\\n    url: string | null;\\n    apiToken: string | null;\\n  };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*   **`mode`**: Determines the operational mode. Defaults to `'local'`.\\n*   **`backend.url`**: The base URL of the backend API.\\n*   **`backend.apiToken`**: The authentication token for the backend API.\\n\\nThese settings will be persisted on disk and loaded at startup.\\n\\n## 3. Configuration Sources and Priority\\n\\nThe backend configuration can be provided through multiple sources, with the following priority:\\n\\n1.  **Persisted User Settings (UI)**: Values set by the user in the settings screen.\\n2.  **Environment Variables**: For easier configuration in development or CI/CD environments.\\n    *   `BACKEND_URL`\\n    *   `BACKEND_API_TOKEN`\\n3.  **Default Values**: `mode` defaults to `'local'`.\\n\\nOn startup, the application will resolve the configuration by checking these sources in order. If environment variables are present, they can be used to pre-fill the settings UI.\\n\\n## 4. UI Specification\\n\\nA new \\\"Settings\\\" screen will be added to the application. It will contain a section for \\\"Mode\\\".\\n\\n*   **Mode Selector**: A radio button or dropdown to select \\\"Local\\\" or \\\"Online\\\".\\n*   **Backend Configuration (visible if \\\"Online\\\" is selected)**:\\n    *   **Backend URL**: A text input for the service URL.\\n    *   **API Token**: A password input for the API token.\\n    *   **\\\"Test Connection\\\" Button**: A button to validate the URL and token. It should provide feedback (e.g., \\\"Connection successful\\\" or \\\"Error: ...\\\").\\n*   **\\\"Save\\\" Button**: To persist the settings. The application might need to be restarted for the mode change to take full effect, which should be communicated to the user.\\n\\n## 5. Connection Validation and Fallback\\n\\nWhen in \\\"Online\\\" mode, the main process will attempt to connect to the backend at startup.\\n\\n*   **Validation**: A dedicated endpoint on the backend (e.g., `/api/v1/health` or `/api/v1/status`) will be used to check the connection and authentication.\\n*   **Fallback**: If the connection fails at startup or during an operation:\\n    *   The UI will display a prominent, non-blocking notification that the backend is unreachable.\\n    *   The application will enter a read-only or degraded state for online-only features.\\n    *   It **will not** automatically fall back to local mode to avoid data conflicts or unexpected behavior. The user must explicitly switch back to local mode via settings.\\n\\n## 6. Adapter API\\n\\nTo abstract the business logic from the transport layer, we will introduce an adapter pattern. A common interface will be defined, with two implementations:\\n\\n*   **`LocalAdapter`**: Interacts directly with `factory-ts` and the local filesystem. This will encapsulate the existing logic.\\n*   **`BackendAdapter`**: Makes HTTP requests to the remote backend API.\\n\\nThis interface will cover all project and agent-related operations.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// src/main/adapters/interface.ts (conceptual)\\n\\n// Simplified example. This will be expanded to cover all operations.\\ninterface IProjectAdapter {\\n  // Project Management\\n  listProjects(): Promise<Project[]>;\\n  openProject(path: string): Promise<ProjectDetails>;\\n  createProject(name: string, path: string): Promise<Project>;\\n\\n  // Task Management\\n  getTasks(projectId: string): Promise<Task[]>;\\n  createTask(projectId: string, description: string): Promise<Task>;\\n\\n  // Agent Operations\\n  runAgent(projectId: string, taskId: string, agentConfig: AgentConfig): Promise<AgentRun>;\\n  getAgentRunStatus(runId: string): Promise<AgentRunStatus>;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe main process will instantiate the appropriate adapter based on the configured `mode`.\\n\\n## 7. IPC Contract Updates\\n\\nThe existing IPC channels between the renderer and the main process will be maintained. However, the handlers in the main process will be updated to delegate calls to the currently active adapter (`LocalAdapter` or `BackendAdapter`).\\n\\n**Example Flow (Listing Projects):**\\n\\n1.  **Renderer**: `ipcRenderer.invoke('projects:list')`\\n2.  **Main Process (`main.js`)**:\\n    *   Receives the `'projects:list'` call.\\n    *   Gets the active adapter instance from a service/manager.\\n    *   `const projects = await activeAdapter.listProjects();`\\n    *   Returns `projects` to the renderer.\\n\\nThis ensures the renderer remains agnostic to the operational mode. The logic is centralized in the main process.\\n\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"finish_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The common ground where all project data would be located is a git repository.\nSo there needs to be a backend that would allow for clients to do everything this app does (manipulate projects/tasks/features) and launch agents on them.\nThis means we also need to have a service for running agents as part of the backend (could be a micro-service that the main backend relays to).\n\nOne important requirement is that a client (like this one) might still want to run everything locally without touching the backend. It must still be possible to do so, which means that all project related data lives in the repository, apart from big blob data. Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one. Not as a package, because the backend isn't a library. They might have shared code - in which case, we have to create yet another project for the shared library code.\nThe initial backend task will be in this project, and once it's running we will migrate to have a task for further features in its project and another task here for further improving this app's usage of it.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Client BackendAdapter Integration Plan (ID: 1ace7bce-e474-4fec-977c-823ab2e7a995)\n##DESCRIPTION: Define the client-side service that talks to the backend API: methods mapping to project/task/feature CRUD, run creation, and event streaming.

Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content.

Overview\\n\\nThe protocol provides a unified way for clients to receive status updates, progress information, and logs from agent runs. It is designed to be resilient to network interruptions and ensures clients can catch up on missed events after a disconnection.\\n\\nThe primary transport mechanisms are WebSocket and Server-Sent Events (SSE), providing low-latency, server-pushed updates.\\n\\n## 2. Transport\\n\\nClients can choose to connect via either WebSocket or SSE.\\n\\n-   **WebSocket**: Offers a persistent, bidirectional connection. Ideal for clients that may also need to send commands back to the server in the future.\\n-   **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: A simpler, unidirectional (server-to-client) protocol built on HTTP. It has built-in support for automatic reconnection in most client libraries.\\n\\nEndpoints will be specified in the project's OpenAPI definition (e.g., `/api/v1/agents/{runId}/events`).\\n\\n## 3. Connection & Reconnection\\n\\n### 3.1. Establishing a Connection\\n\\n-   The client initiates a connection to the appropriate endpoint (WebSocket upgrade or SSE event stream).\\n-   A `runId` must be provided to subscribe to events for a specific agent run.\\n\\n### 3.2. Reconnection\\n\\nClients should implement a reconnection strategy with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server.\\n\\nUpon a successful reconnection, the client can request missed events to ensure a consistent state. This is handled via a `lastEventId` mechanism.\\n\\n### 3.3. Backfill on Reconnect\\n\\nTo get missed events after a disconnection, the client can include a `Last-Event-ID` header (for SSE) or a query parameter `lastEventId` (for WebSocket) in its connection request.\\n\\n-   The server will then \\\"backfill\\\" by sending all events that occurred after the event with the given ID, before streaming new, live events.\\n-   Each event sent by the server will have a unique, sequential `eventId`.\\n\\n## 4. Correlation\\n\\nEvery event is associated with a specific agent run.\\n\\n-   `runId`: A unique identifier for a single execution of an agent. This is the primary key for subscribing to an event stream.\\n-   `correlationId`: Can be used to trace a logical operation across multiple services or agent steps. This is optional and is carried within the event payload if provided during agent invocation.\\n\\n## 5. Event Schema\\n\\nAll events are sent as JSON objects with a common structure.\\n\\n**Base Event Structure:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"eventId\\\": \\\"string\\\",      // Unique, sequential ID for the event (e.g., timestamp-based ULID)\\n  \\\"eventType\\\": \\\"string\\\",    // The type of the event (e.g., \\\"agent.status.update\\\")\\n  \\\"runId\\\": \\\"string\\\",        // ID of the agent run this event belongs to\\n  \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"string\\\",    // ISO 8601 timestamp\\n  \\\"payload\\\": {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--- \\n\\n### Event Types\\n\\n#### `agent.status.update`\\n\\nFired when the overall status of the agent run changes.\\n\\n**Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"queued\\\" | \\\"started\\\" | \\\"running\\\" | \\\"completed\\\" | \\\"failed\\\" | \\\"cancelled\\\",\\n  \\\"details\\\": \\\"string\\\" // Optional human-readable details, especially for 'failed' status\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### `agent.log`\\n\\nStreams log output from the agent.\\n\\n**Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"level\\\": \\\"info\\\" | \\\"warn\\\" | \\\"error\\\" | \\\"debug\\\",\\n  \\\"message\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n  \\\"source\\\": \\\"string\\\" // e.g., 'stdout', 'stderr', 'agent.tool'\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### `agent.progress.update`\\n\\nProvides structured information about the agent's progress.\\n\\n**Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"currentStep\\\": \\\"string\\\", // A description of the current task\\n  \\\"totalSteps\\\": \\\"number\\\", // Optional: total number of steps\\n  \\\"stepNumber\\\": \\\"number\\\", // Optional: current step number\\n  \\\"progressPercentage\\\": \\\"number\\\" // Optional: a value from 0 to 100\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### `system.error`\\n\\nSent by the server if an error occurs with the event stream itself.\\n\\n**Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"code\\\": \\\"string\\\", // Error code\\n  \\\"message\\\": \\\"string\\\" // Error message\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### `system.heartbeat`\\n\\nSent periodically to keep the connection alive and allow clients to detect a dead connection if no events are being sent.\\n\\n**Payload:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"serverTime\\\": \\\"string\\\" // ISO 8601 timestamp\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--- \\n\\n## 6.

The common ground where all project data would be located is a git repository.\nSo there needs to be a backend that would allow for clients to do everything this app does (manipulate projects/tasks/features) and launch agents on them.\nThis means we also need to have a service for running agents as part of the backend (could be a micro-service that the main backend relays to).\n\nOne important requirement is that a client (like this one) might still want to run everything locally without touching the backend.

Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one.
