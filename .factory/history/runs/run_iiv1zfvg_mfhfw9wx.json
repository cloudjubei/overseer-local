Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f72dbcdb-77e7-4d00-bf72-e2cc59271644)\n##TITLE:\nMain project structure based on the graphiti library\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThere's a library `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti` that provides an upgraded RAG database - a knowledge graph. This project needs to be able to run locally and must expose an API that any client can interact with.\nFor reference, the whole library has been added under `graphiti/` .\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: When

Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object.

The traceback points to `src/main.py`, line 71, inside the `add_document` function. The error occurs when `JSONResponse` tries to serialize the `result` object, which apparently contains a `datetime` object. The `result` comes from `graph_service.add_document()`. To fix this, I need to modify how the response is created in the `add_document` endpoint. FastAPI has a built-in `jsonable_encoder` that handles types like `datetime` automatically when you return a dictionary or a Pydantic model from an endpoint. Currently, the code explicitly uses `JSONResponse`, which bypasses this automatic encoding. The cleanest solution is to remove the explicit `JSONResponse` and instead return a dictionary directly. The `status_code` can be set in the endpoint decorator `@app.post(\\\"/documents\\\", status_code=201)`. I will first read the content of `src/main.py`, then apply this change, and finally write the modified file back.\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"tool_name\":\"read_files\",\"arguments\":{\"paths\":[\"src/main.py\"]}}]}",

The best practice is to return a dictionary or a Pydantic model and let FastAPI manage the response serialization.

This allows FastAPI's `jsonable_encoder` to handle the serialization of `datetime` objects. I applied this fix to all endpoints for consistency. The feature should now be implemented correctly. I will mark it as complete.\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"tool_name\":\"finish_feature\",\"arguments\":{}}]}",
