          "content": "# Speccer Agent Task Execution\n\nYou are the Speccer Agent. Your single responsibility is to analyze a user-provided task description and break it down into a series of atomic, implementable features. Your goal is to produce a complete and logical plan for the Developer agents to follow. You should try to tailor the feature titles and descriptions to be the best for LLMs to follow.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze**: Carefully read the task's title and description to fully understand the goal. Consider the project's existing structure and conventions.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Investigate**: Use the `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations to understand the project further.\n4.  **Create Features**: Formulate a list of consecutive, atomic features required to accomplish the task. Each feature should be a small, logical, and testable unit of work. Use the `create_feature` tool for each one you identify.\n5.  **Finish**: Once the features are created, you **MUST** call the `finish_spec` tool to complete your assignment.\n6.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_task` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 0f49d8be-d912-48da-a210-617117d06bf2)\n##TITLE:\nIntegrate `thefactory-db` Search into Main Project Tools\n##DESCRIPTION:\nRefactor the existing `search_files` tool in the main project's @src/tools/fileTools.ts . The updated tool should act as a facade that first attempts to perform a hybrid search using the `thefactory-db` package. If the database is not available or the search fails, it must fall back to the original file-based search logic to ensure system resilience and backward compatibility.\nMake sure @src/tools/fileTools.ts uses the new package in the appropriate manner - a correct db connection string should be passed to it and if it is passed, then the search should use it. The places where it needs to be passed through is in @src/index.ts  (the function 'startRun') and @src/tools/chatTools.ts (the function 'buildChatTools' ).\n\nif there's an error in the db search - we should also fall back to the standard file search that is already there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- create_feature(title: str, description: str) - Define and add a new, atomic feature to the task. Include a concise title and a clear description.\n- finish_spec() - Signal that the feature specification is complete for the current task.\n- block_task() - Stop work on the task and report why you are blocked at the task level.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# Project File and Tooling Organisation\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n- This repository implements a multi-agent development workflow, with tools for reading/writing files, managing tasks and features, running tests, and exposing these as chat-callable tools.\\n- Source code lives under src/. Tasks and artifacts live under tasks/. Documentation lives under docs/.\\n- The main toolsets are composed in src/tools/tools.ts.\\n\\n## Top-level Layout\\n\\n- docs/: Human-facing documentation for agents, communication protocol, and project overview.\\n- src/: Source code for orchestration, tooling, and types.\\n- tasks/: Per-task directories containing task.json and related test files.\\n- types/: Type declaration helpers (e.g., markdown.d.ts).\\n- package.json, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts: Build/test configuration.\\n\\n## Key Source Modules\\n\\n- src/index.ts: Entry point/export surface for the library (wires up orchestrator/tools). It re-exports the agent run store API from src/agentRunStore.ts.\\n- src/agentRunStore.ts: Agent run storage module. Provides file-backed persistence used to track current and past runs and their messages.\\n  - Exports:\\n    - createAgentRunStore({ dbPath }): AgentRunStore — creates a file-backed store under <dirname(dbPath)>/history.\\n    - types AgentRunHistory, AgentRunMessage, AgentRunState, AgentRunStore to model run data and the store interface.\\n  - Behaviour:\\n    - Stores a single per-run history file at history/runs/<runId>.json that matches the AgentRunHistory schema (includes messages).\\n    - Active runs are kept in memory during execution and are only discarded from memory after a final state (completed/cancelled/error) has been persisted. Finished runs are read-only and can be deleted.\\n- src/orchestrator.ts: Orchestration logic to coordinate agents and tools (drives workflows around tasks/features). Emits detailed llm/messages/\\\\* snapshots throughout a run which src/index.ts listens to and persists through AgentRunStore.\\n- src/gitManager.ts: Thin wrapper managing git operations (e.g., pushAll) used by task and feature flows.\\n- src/logger.ts: Logging utilities.\\n- src/completion.ts: AI completion utilities.\\n- src/pricing.ts: Default/model pricing utilities (used by orchestration and completion logic).\\n- src/utils.ts: Misc helpers and utilities for filesystem-safe operations and path helpers:\\n  - ensureDir(dir)\\n  - isWithinRoot(root, abs)\\n  - getTasksDir(root)\\n  - getTaskPath(root, taskId)\\n  - getTestPath(root, taskId, featureId)\\n  - getProjectsDir(root)\\n  - getProjectPath(root, projectId)\\n  - uuidv4()\\n\\n## Tasks and Features\\n\\n- tasks/<taskId>/\\n  - task.json: canonical task spec with features and status.\\n  - tests/ or per-feature test paths as determined by getTestPath in workflowUtils.\\n\\n## Documentation (docs/)\\n\\n- AGENT\\\\_\\\\* files describe roles and protocols: Developer, Planner, Tester, Speccer, Contexter.\\n- AGENT_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md: General messaging and tool-calling protocols.\\n- FILE_ORGANISATION.md: This file.\\n\\n## Tools Overview (src/tools)\\n\\nAll toolsets are factory functions taking a projectRoot (string) unless stateless.\\n\\n### fileTools (src/tools/fileTools.ts)\\n\\n- createFileTools(projectRoot): returns FileTools API\\n  - listFiles(path): string[] — list entries of a directory (project-relative). Returns [] if invalid.\\n  - readFiles(paths: string[]): JSON-stringified map relPath -> content|listing|error.\\n  - writeFile(path, content): writes text content; creates directories; security checked.\\n  - renameFile(src, dst): rename/move with security checks.\\n  - deleteFile(path): deletes file or directory (non-recursive rmdir for directories).\\n  - searchFiles(query, path='.'): filesystem scan.\\n\\n### taskTools (src/tools/taskTools.ts)\\n\\n- createTaskTools(projectRoot): returns TaskTools API operating on tasks/<taskId>/task.json.\\n  - listTasks(): Task[] — enumerate tasks by reading all tasks/\\\\*/task.json.\\n  - getTask(taskId): Task\\n  - saveTask(task): void\\n  - updateTaskStatus(taskId, status): Task\\n  - blockTask(taskId, reason, agentType, git): Task — sets blocked, commits via git.pushAll.\\n  - finishSpec(taskId, agentType, git): void — marks spec finished via git.\\n  - getFeatureFromIndex(taskId, index): Feature|undefined — resolve feature by display index.\\n  - createFeature(taskId, title, description): Feature — updates indices and task status.\\n  - updateFeatureStatus(taskId, featureId, status): Feature|undefined\\n  - updateFeaturePlan(taskId, featureId, plan): Feature|undefined — persists plan (stringified).\\n  - updateFeatureContext(taskId, featureId, context: string[]): Feature|undefined\\n  - updateFeatureAcceptance(taskId, featureId, acceptance): Feature|undefined\\n  - blockFeature(taskId, featureId, reason, agentType, git): Feature|undefined — sets blocked and commits.\\n  - finishFeature(taskId, featureId, agentType, git): string — updates feature status based on agent and commits.\\n\\n### projectTools (src/tools/projectTools.ts)\\n\\n- createProjectTools(projectRoot): returns ProjectTools API for project metadata.\\n  - getProject(projectId): ProjectSpec — loads project spec at getProjectPath(root, projectId).\\n  - getProjectDir(projectId): string — resolves the project working directory under getProjectsDir(root) + project.path.\\n  - getTaskIdFromIndex(projectId, index): string|undefined — reverse-lookup task id by display index from project.taskIdToDisplayIndex.\\n\\n### testTools (src/tools/testTools.ts)\\n\\n- createTestTools(projectRoot): returns TestTools API; test files are Python scripts addressed by task/feature.\\n  - getTest(taskId, featureId): string — reads contents or returns not-found message.\\n  - updateTest(taskId, featureId, test: string): string — writes test to path from getTestPath.\\n  - deleteTest(taskId, featureId): string — deletes if present.\\n  - runTest(taskId, featureId): string — executes python3 on the test file with a 30s kill timeout; returns PASS/FAIL and captured output.\\n\\n### webSearchTools (src/tools/webSearchTools.ts)\\n\\n- createWebSearchTools(webSearchApiKeys): returns WebSearchTools API for normalized web search across providers.\\n  - webSearch({ query, limit?, providers? }): chooses provider by availability or explicit in order of selection.\\n\\n### chatTools (src/tools/chatTools.ts)\\n\\n- buildChatTools({ repoRoot, projectId }): returns { tools, callTool } for LLM tool calling.\\n  - tools: array of ChatTool descriptors (OpenAI function tool format) exposing various other tools:\\n    - list_tasks\\n    - get_task_reference(reference: '#<task>[.<feature>]')\\n    - list_files(path)\\n    - search_files(query[, path])\\n    - read_files(paths[])\\n    - write_file(name, content)\\n    - web_search(query[, limit, providers])\\n\\n## Tool Composition (src/tools/tools.ts)\\n\\n- createTools(projectRoot, webSearchApiKeys) merges APIs:\\n  - ...createTaskTools(projectRoot)\\n  - ...createTestTools(projectRoot)\\n  - ...createFileTools(projectRoot)\\n  - ...createProjectTools(projectRoot)\\n  - ...createWebSearchTools(webSearchApiKeys)\\n\\n## Agent Run Persistence (src/agentRunStore.ts)\\n\\n- The app tracks agent runs and their message transcripts via an AgentRunStore implementation.\\n- Directory layout (relative to provided dbPath):\\n  - history/runs/<runId>.json — single-file per run containing AgentRunHistory (meta and messages in one file). No index file is used.\\n- API:\\n  - createAgentRunStore({ dbPath }): AgentRunStore\\n  - AgentRunStore methods: listRuns, addRun, updateRun, addMessages, getRun, deleteRun\\n- Behaviour:\\n  - listRuns/getRun scan the runs directory and load run files.\\n  - Active runs are kept in memory during execution and are only discarded from memory after a final state (completed/cancelled/error) has been persisted. Finished runs are read-only (updateRun/addMessages are no-ops for finalized runs) and can be deleted.\\n\\n## Extending Tools\\n\\n- Add a new toolset file under src/tools/, export a factory createXTools(projectRoot) returning an object of functions.\\n- Update src/tools/tools.ts to spread ...createXTools(projectRoot) into the composed API.\\n- If you want the tool callable from chat, add a ChatTool descriptor to tools[] and a case in callTool(name, args) in src/tools/chatTools.ts.\\n- Follow security patterns: resolve absolute paths using project root, guard with isWithinRoot for filesystem operations, and ensure directories exist via ensureDir.\\n\\n## Conventions and Notes\\n\\n- All filesystem operations are project-root-scoped and must not escape the repo.\\n- Search is keyword-based, space-separated, case-insensitive, and size-limited to 2MB files.\\n- GitManager is expected to implement pushAll(message) used by task/feature state transitions.\\n\\nNote: The previous index/messages split has been replaced by single-file per run persistence.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",
