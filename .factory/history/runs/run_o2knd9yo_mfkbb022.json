          "content": "# Speccer Agent Task Execution\n\nYou are the Speccer Agent. Your single responsibility is to analyze a user-provided task description and break it down into a series of atomic, implementable features. Your goal is to produce a complete and logical plan for the Developer agents to follow. You should try to tailor the feature titles and descriptions to be the best for LLMs to follow.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze**: Carefully read the task's title and description to fully understand the goal. Consider the project's existing structure and conventions.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Investigate**: Use the `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations to understand the project further.\n4.  **Create Features**: Formulate a list of consecutive, atomic features required to accomplish the task. Each feature should be a small, logical, and testable unit of work. Use the `create_feature` tool for each one you identify.\n5.  **Finish**: Once the features are created, you **MUST** call the `finish_spec` tool to complete your assignment.\n6.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_task` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: c895c02d-7c6a-4b77-a3ae-4e9ede935c2c)\n##TITLE:\nIntegrate `thefactory-db`\n##DESCRIPTION:\nA new project has been added to this one 'thefactory-db' . It allows storing documents and entities into a database and performing hybrid search on them (tokenized + embedding search). 'thefactory-tools' is already updated to use it - mainly for the 'search_files' tool that this projects 'FilesManager' uses.\n\nThis project needs to be the one that initiates the connection with 'thefactory-db'. It will then pass the appropriate connection info to 'thefactory-tools'.\nApart from integrating with both of the packages well - this project also needs to make sure that all the files within this project's repo are added to 'thefactory-db' and its \"documents\" table (there's a \"addDocument\" function exposed). Documents are text conten. For code files within this project, we should assign a \"project_code\" type to them. For any other project related file - \"project_file\", and for any external files in the future \"external_file\". \nOn app start - during the loading screen - each project needs to be checked to see if all the relevant documents are in the database - and if not, they need to be added. While the app is working and there are changes to the project's files - they should be appropriately updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- create_feature(title: str, description: str) - Define and add a new, atomic feature to the task. Include a concise title and a clear description.\n- finish_spec() - Signal that the feature specification is complete for the current task.\n- block_task() - Stop work on the task and report why you are blocked at the task level.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\n    - providers/: Pluggable provider implementations (e.g., agent-prices bridge, generic fetch-json).\\n    - registry.js: Provider registry to map service ids to providers.\\n    - store.js: Persistence for service configs and cached snapshots by service id.\\n    - types.js: Shared types and helpers (freshness policy, normalization, freshness computation).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n    - settings/: AppSettings React context provider used app-wide (singleton).\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT\\\\_\\\\*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",
