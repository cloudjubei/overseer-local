          "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f72dbcdb-77e7-4d00-bf72-e2cc59271644)\n##TITLE:\nMain project structure based on the graphiti library\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThere's a library `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti` that provides an upgraded RAG database - a knowledge graph. This project needs to be able to run locally and must expose an API that any client can interact with.\nFor reference, the whole library has been added under `graphiti/` .\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: The project depends on neo4j - explain how to create it and run locally (ID: 9b9695d3-6bb2-4864-8ba8-ee606ff48f55)\n##DESCRIPTION: Explain the exact steps the user must follow from scratch so that they can have this running and serving clients over the REST API - all in @README.md .\n\n\n\n\n#ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up Neo4j locally from scratch:\\n\\nOption 1: Neo4j with Docker (Recommended for Development)\\n\\n1) Install Docker\\n   - Download and install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop\\n   - Verify installation: `docker --version`\\n\\n2) Create a Neo4j container\\n   Choose a strong password and replace 'your_secure_password' in the command below:\\n   \\n   docker run -d \\\\\\n     --name neo4j-graphiti \\\\\\n     -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \\\\\\n     -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your_secure_password \\\\\\n     -v neo4j-data:/data \\\\\\n     -v neo4j-logs:/logs \\\\\\n     -v neo4j-import:/var/lib/neo4j/import \\\\\\n     -v neo4j-plugins:/plugins \\\\\\n     neo4j:5-community\\n\\n   This command:\\n   - Creates a container named 'neo4j-graphiti'\\n   - Exposes port 7474 (web interface) and 7687 (bolt protocol)\\n   - Sets username 'neo4j' with your chosen password\\n   - Creates persistent volumes for data, logs, imports, and plugins\\n   - Uses Neo4j Community Edition version 5\\n\\n3) Verify Neo4j is running\\n   Check container status:\\n   docker ps\\n   \\n   You should see the neo4j-graphiti container in the list.\\n   \\n   Check logs for any errors:\\n   docker logs neo4j-graphiti\\n   \\n   Wait for the message \\\"Started\\\" to appear in the logs (this may take 30-60 seconds on first startup).\\n\\n4) Access Neo4j Browser (Optional)\\n   Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:7474\\n   \\n   Login with:\\n   - Username: neo4j\\n   - Password: your_secure_password (the one you set in step 2)\\n   \\n   You should see the Neo4j Browser interface, confirming the database is ready.\\n\\n5) Test connectivity\\n   Run a simple test query in Neo4j Browser:\\n   MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)\\n   \\n   This should return 0 (empty database) without errors.\\n\\nOption 2: Neo4j Desktop (GUI Application)\\n\\n1) Download Neo4j Desktop\\n   - Go to https://neo4j.com/download/\\n   - Download Neo4j Desktop for your operating system\\n   - Install following the platform-specific instructions\\n\\n2) Create a new project\\n   - Launch Neo4j Desktop\\n   - Click \\\"New Project\\\" and give it a name (e.g., \\\"Graphiti API\\\")\\n\\n3) Create a database\\n   - In your project, click \\\"Add Database\\\" → \\\"Local DBMS\\\"\\n   - Name: \\\"graphiti-db\\\" (or your preferred name)\\n   - Password: Choose a secure password\\n   - Version: Select Neo4j 5.x (latest available)\\n   - Click \\\"Create\\\"\\n\\n4) Start the database\\n   - Click the \\\"Start\\\" button on your database\\n   - Wait for the status to show \\\"Active\\\" (green dot)\\n\\n5) Note connection details\\n   - Click on your database to see details\\n   - Note the bolt URL (typically bolt://localhost:7687)\\n   - Username is 'neo4j' by default\\n   - Password is what you set in step 3\\n\\nOption 3: Neo4j Server Installation (Production)\\n\\nFor production deployments, follow the official Neo4j installation guide:\\nhttps://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/\\n\\nManaging Your Neo4j Instance\\n\\nStarting Neo4j (Docker method):\\ndocker start neo4j-graphiti\\n\\nStopping Neo4j (Docker method):\\ndocker stop neo4j-graphiti\\n\\nViewing logs (Docker method):\\ndocker logs neo4j-graphiti\\n\\nRemoving Neo4j container (if needed):\\ndocker stop neo4j-graphiti\\ndocker rm neo4j-graphiti\\n# Note: This removes the container but preserves data in volumes\\n\\nQuick Start\\n\\nOnce Neo4j is running, choose one of these options to run the Graphiti API:\\n\\nOption A: Run locally with Poetry\\n1) Clone and enter the repo\\n   git clone <your-repo-url>\\n   cd <your-repo>\\n\\n2) Set required environment (Neo4j)\\n   The API requires access to your Neo4j instance. Create a .env file at the repo root:\\n   \\n   # Neo4j Connection (Required)\\n   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687\\n   NEO4J_USER=neo4j\\n   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_secure_password\\n   \\n   # API Settings (Optional)\\n   API_HOST=0.0.0.0\\n   API_PORT=8000\\n   LOG_LEVEL=INFO\\n   \\n   # Graphiti Options (Optional)\\n   GRAPHITI_STORAGE_PATH=./data/graphiti\\n   GRAPHITI_RESET=false\\n   GRAPHITI_MODEL=\\n   GRAPHITI_COLLECTION=\\n   \\n   Replace 'your_secure_password' with the password you set for Neo4j.\\n\\n3) Install dependencies\\n   poetry install\\n\\n4) Run the application\\n   poetry run uvicorn graphiti_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload\\n\\n5) Verify everything works\\n   Test the health endpoint:\\n   curl http://localhost:8000/health\\n   \\n   Expected response: {\\\"status\\\": \\\"ok\\\"}\\n   \\n   Open the API docs:\\n   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs\\n   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc\\n\\nOption B: Run with Docker\\nA. Build and run directly\\n1) Build the image\\n   docker build -t graphiti-api:local .\\n\\n2) Run the container (pass Neo4j creds)\\n   docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \\\\\\n     -e NEO4J_URI=bolt://host.docker.internal:7687 \\\\\\n     -e NEO4J_USER=neo4j \\\\\\n     -e NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_secure_password \\\\\\n     -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \\\\\\n     --name graphiti-api graphiti-api:local\\n\\n   Note: On Linux, replace host.docker.internal with your host IP or run Neo4j in another container on the same network.\\n\\n3) Visit docs\\n   http://localhost:8000/docs\\n\\nB. Use Docker Compose\\nThe provided docker-compose.yml defines the API service but does not inject your environment variables by default. Create an override file to pass them through.\\n\\n1) Create docker-compose.override.yml with your env:\\n   services:\\n     api:\\n       environment:\\n         - NEO4J_URI=${NEO4J_URI}\\n         - NEO4J_USER=${NEO4J_USER}\\n         - NEO4J_PASSWORD=${NEO4J_PASSWORD}\\n         - API_HOST=${API_HOST:-0.0.0.0}\\n         - API_PORT=${API_PORT:-8000}\\n         - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}\\n\\n2) Create a .env file at repo root with values:\\n   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687\\n   NEO4J_USER=neo4j\\n   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_secure_password\\n\\n3) Start the service\\n   docker compose up --build\\n\\n4) Visit docs\\n   http://localhost:8000/docs\\n\\nComplete Setup Verification\\n\\nTo ensure everything is working correctly:\\n\\n1) Test the health endpoint:\\n   curl http://localhost:8000/health\\n   Expected: {\\\"status\\\": \\\"ok\\\"}\\n\\n2) Test document ingestion:\\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \\\\\\n     -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n     -d '{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Neo4j is a graph database that stores data as nodes and relationships.\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"title\\\": \\\"Neo4j Intro\\\"}}'\\n   \\n   Expected: {\\\"success\\\": true, \\\"result\\\": {\\\"episode_uuid\\\": \\\"...\\\", ...}}\\n\\n3) Test querying:\\n   curl -G http://localhost:8000/query --data-urlencode \\\"q=what is Neo4j\\\"\\n   \\n   Expected: {\\\"query\\\": \\\"what is Neo4j\\\", \\\"results\\\": [...]}\\n\\nIf all tests pass, your Graphiti API is successfully connected to Neo4j and ready to serve clients!\\n\\nConfiguration\\nEnvironment variables (authoritative names are in src/graphiti_api/config.py):\\n- API_HOST: Host interface for the API (default: 0.0.0.0)\\n- API_PORT: Port for the API (default: 8000)\\n- LOG_LEVEL: Logging level (default: INFO)\\n\\n- NEO4J_URI: Required. Example: bolt://localhost:7687\\n- NEO4J_USER: Required. Example: neo4j\\n- NEO4J_PASSWORD: Required. Example: your_password\\n\\nOptional Graphiti-related settings (may be used in future features):\\n- GRAPHITI_STORAGE_PATH: Default ./data/graphiti\\n- GRAPHITI_RESET: Reset underlying storage on startup (default: false)\\n- GRAPHITI_MODEL: Optional model name\\n- GRAPHITI_COLLECTION: Optional collection/namespace\\n\\nAPI Usage\\n- Health check\\n  Method: GET\\n  URL: /health\\n  Example:\\n    curl -s http://localhost:8000/health\\n  Response:\\n    {\\\"status\\\": \\\"ok\\\"}\\n\\n- Ingest document\\n  Method: POST\\n  URL: /documents\\n  Body (JSON):\\n    {\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"Graphiti is a knowledge graph for RAG.\\\",\\n      \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"title\\\": \\\"Intro\\\", \\\"source\\\": \\\"docs\\\"}\\n    }\\n  Example:\\n    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \\\\\\n      -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n      -d '{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Graphiti is a knowledge graph for RAG.\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"title\\\": \\\"Intro\\\"}}'\\n  Success response (201):\\n    {\\\"success\\\": true, \\\"result\\\": {\\\"episode_uuid\\\": \\\"...\\\", \\\"counts\\\": { ... }, \\\"raw\\\": { ... }}}\\n\\n- Query graph\\n  Method: GET\\n  URL: /query\\n  Params:\\n    - q: query string (required)\\n    - top_k: max results (default 5)\\n  Example:\\n    curl -G http://localhost:8000/query --data-urlencode \\\"q=what is graphiti\\\" --data-urlencode \\\"top_k=5\\\"\\n  Success response (200):\\n    {\\\"query\\\": \\\"what is graphiti\\\", \\\"results\\\": [ {\\\"uuid\\\": \\\"...\\\", \\\"fact\\\": \\\"...\\\", ...}, ... ]}\\n\\nNotes\\n- The Graphiti API expects a working Neo4j connection. If connection variables are missing or incorrect, endpoints like /documents and /query will return 503/500 errors.\\n- Additional provider-specific settings (e.g., for embeddings or LLMs) may be required depending on how you extend Graphiti usage. Consult the Graphiti documentation if you integrate those features.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n- Code location: src/graphiti_api/\\n  - main.py: FastAPI app and routes\\n  - graph_service.py: Graphiti integration (init, add document, search)\\n  - config.py: Settings and logging configuration\\n- Run locally (dev):\\n  poetry run uvicorn graphiti_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload\\n- Formatting/linting: Add your preferred tools (e.g., ruff, black, isort) to pyproject.toml.\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nNeo4j Connection Issues:\\n- Connection refused to bolt://localhost:7687: \\n  * Check if Neo4j is running: `docker ps` (for Docker) or check Neo4j Desktop\\n  * Verify the port 7687 is not blocked by firewall\\n  * Ensure NEO4J_URI matches your Neo4j instance address\\n\\n- Authentication failed:\\n  * Verify NEO4J_USER and NEO4J_PASSWORD match your Neo4j credentials\\n  * For new Neo4j instances, the default user is 'neo4j'\\n  * Check if you need to change the initial password\\n\\n- Neo4j container won't start:\\n  * Check logs: `docker logs neo4j-graphiti`\\n  * Ensure ports 7474 and 7687 are not already in use\\n  * Try removing and recreating the container\\n\\nAPI Issues:\\n- 503 Service Unavailable when calling endpoints: Ensure NEO4J_URI/USER/PASSWORD are set correctly and Neo4j is reachable.\\n- 500 errors during ingestion/search: Increase verbosity with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG and check logs.\\n- Docker networking on Linux: If using docker run, host.docker.internal may not resolve; use the host IP or run Neo4j in a user-defined network with the API container.\\n\\nGetting Help:\\n- Check Neo4j logs: `docker logs neo4j-graphiti`\\n- Check API logs when running with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG\\n- Verify connectivity with Neo4j Browser at http://localhost:7474\\n- Test basic Neo4j queries before testing the API\\n\\nLicense\\nSee LICENSE in this repository.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n- Graphiti by Zep: https://github.com/getzep/graphiti\\n- FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\\n- Neo4j: https://neo4j.com/\"}}]}",
