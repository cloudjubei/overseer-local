          "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Implement Core Model and Service for Areas of Knowledge (ID: db934d89-f61d-4874-a247-f277200d014b)\n##DESCRIPTION: Define the data model for an 'Area of Knowledge' in the graph. Update `graph_service.py` to support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for these areas. An 'Area' will be represented as a distinct node type in the knowledge graph, serving as a container for related concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create FastAPI Endpoints for Managing Areas of Knowledge (ID: 79168319-e339-4765-8ab8-9941c09d7254)\n##DESCRIPTION: Implement a new FastAPI router at `/areas`. This router will provide RESTful endpoints for managing Areas of Knowledge. It should include endpoints for `POST /areas` (create), `GET /areas` (list), `GET /areas/{area_name}` (retrieve), `PUT /areas/{area_name}` (update), and `DELETE /areas/{area_name}` (delete). These endpoints will use the functionality added to `graph_service.py`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`.

Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Implement Logic and API to Link Entities to Areas (ID: 0fadda3f-1ddf-4ec7-bf0a-8ccceea84336)\n##DESCRIPTION: Develop the mechanism to associate existing graph entities (nodes) with specific Areas of Knowledge. This will be achieved by creating a `BELONGS_TO` relationship between an entity node and an area node. Create API endpoints to manage these associations: `POST /areas/{area_name}/entities`, `GET /areas/{area_name}/entities`, and `DELETE /areas/{area_name}/entities/{entity_id}`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

If connection variables are missing or incorrect, endpoints like /documents and /query will return 503/500 errors.\\\\n- On first run against an empty Neo4j database, the service now auto-creates the schema and fulltext indexes used by Graphiti (e.g., node_name_and_summary, community_name, episode_content, edge_name_and_fact). This prevents errors like \\\\\\\"There is no such fulltext schema index: node_name_and_summary\\\\\\\" and UnknownLabel/UnknownProperty warnings.\\\\n- You can disable automatic schema creation by setting GRAPHITI_INIT_SCHEMA=false.\\\\n- To rebuild indexes from scratch (development only), set GRAPHITI_DELETE_EXISTING_INDEXES=true.\\\\n\\\\nTroubleshooting\\\\n\\\\nNeo4j Connection Issues:\\\\n- Connection refused to bolt://localhost:7687: \\\\n  * Check if Neo4j is running: `docker ps` (for Docker) or check Neo4j Desktop\\\\n  * Verify the port 7687 is not blocked by firewall\\\\n  * Ensure NEO4J_URI matches your Neo4j instance address\\\\n\\\\n- Authentication failed:\\\\n  * Verify NEO4J_USER and NEO4J_PASSWORD match your Neo4j credentials\\\\n  * For new Neo4j instances, the default user is 'neo4j'\\\\n  * Check if you need to change the initial password\\\\n\\\\n- Neo4j container won't start:\\\\n  * Check logs: `docker logs neo4j-graphiti`\\\\n  * Ensure ports 7474 and 7687 are not already in use\\\\n  * Try removing and recreating the container\\\\n\\\\nAPI Issues:\\\\n- 503 Service Unavailable when calling endpoints: Ensure NEO4J_URI/USER/PASSWORD are set correctly and Neo4j is reachable.\\\\n- 500 errors during ingestion/search: Increase verbosity with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG and check logs.\\\\n- Docker networking on Linux: If using docker run, host.docker.internal may not resolve; use the host IP or run Neo4j in a user-defined network with the API container.\\\\n\\\\nLicense\\\\nSee LICENSE in this repository.\\\\n\\\\nAcknowledgements\\\\n- Graphiti by Zep: https://github.com/getzep/graphiti\\\\n- FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\\\\n- Neo4j: https://neo4j.com/\\\\n\\\"}\"}]",

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Enable Querying within a Specific Area of Knowledge (ID: 770a5d0b-8c4e-4bf7-80a2-cd59825c1253)\n##DESCRIPTION: Implement functionality to execute queries that are scoped to a single Area of Knowledge. This involves creating a new service method in `graph_service.py` that filters the graph to include only the nodes and relationships within a given area before running the query. Expose this via a new API endpoint, `POST /areas/{area_name}/query`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

          "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Implement Core Model and Service for Blueprints (ID: 2e73dab8-10bb-4908-a3de-a7090c4fbd4d)\n##DESCRIPTION: Define the data model for 'Blueprints', which act as templates or schemas for knowledge within an Area. A Blueprint should define required properties and relationships for a type of entity. Update `graph_service.py` to manage `Blueprint` nodes and their association with `Area` nodes via an `APPLIES_TO` relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

          "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create FastAPI Endpoints for Managing Blueprints (ID: b0404af3-7525-429a-b9eb-c8bc9b1a52a9)\n##DESCRIPTION: Implement a new FastAPI router at `/blueprints`. Provide CRUD endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blueprints. Also, include an endpoint to associate a blueprint with an Area of Knowledge, e.g., `POST /areas/{area_name}/blueprints`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Develop a High-Level Toolset for Agent Interaction (ID: fdc845ca-af1d-46bc-8966-cd9eb4a9475f)\n##DESCRIPTION: Create a new module `src/agent_tools.py` that provides a simple, high-level functional interface for LLM agents. These functions will wrap the API calls for managing and querying Areas and Blueprints, such as `list_knowledge_areas()`, `get_info_in_area(area_name, query)`, and `find_blueprint_for(entity_type, area_name)`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create Test Scenario for a Coding Project Knowledge Graph (ID: 2105112f-3d14-4c81-8b8a-06b19b0daa93)\n##DESCRIPTION: Develop a test suite under `tests/scenarios/test_coding_project.py`. This test will programmatically create a 'Coding Project' Area, define Blueprints for 'services' and 'views', ingest sample data representing a codebase, and run assertions to verify that scoped queries and blueprint information can be retrieved correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create Test Scenario for an Investment Knowledge Graph (ID: f68649f0-dbf7-4085-8c35-cb1f2ce95cbf)\n##DESCRIPTION: Develop a test suite under `tests/scenarios/test_investment.py`. This test will set up an 'Investment' Area with sub-areas, ingest sample data for cryptocurrencies and commodities, and verify that the system can answer comparative questions by querying within the specific areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\\\\\\\\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \\\\\\\\nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\\\\\\\\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\\\\\\\\n# CODE:\\\\\\\\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\\\\\\\\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\\\\\\\\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# INVESTMENT:\\\\\\\\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\\\\\\\\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#PURCHASES\\\\\\\\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\\\\\\\\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Another note - Blueprints:\\\\\\\\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TESTS\\\\\\\\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\\\\\\\\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\\\\\\\\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"features\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"db934d89-f61d-4874-a247-f277200d014b\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"+\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Implement Core Model and Service for Areas of Knowledge\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Define the data model for an 'Area of Knowledge' in the graph.

          "content": "# Developer Agent Steps Execution\n\nYou are the Developer Agent. You will be assigned a single feature to implement. Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 15a2115a-b435-43f7-a8bc-3346a8868753)\n##TITLE:\nAreas of knowledge\n##DESCRIPTION:\nNow that we have the knowledge graph working using graphiti (included for reference under /graphiti )- clients will want to ask questions about certain 'areas'/'contexts'/'scopes'. Imagine a knowledge graph about finance - it contains information about stocks, companies, cryptocurrencies, commodities etc. The user might want to limit the scope of a context when asking about Bitcoin to just cryptocurrencies - but maybe they want to see how Bitcoin affects the other knowledge or what commonalities it has.\n\nAnother example is a code project - knowing how rendering works is one scope. Inside is the knowledge about various little components. Alongside, how navigation works. Apart from rendering, another separate scope would be networking.\n\nThe system for this needs to allow a user to view and edit various scopes and to see what little pieces of information are held there.\nThese scopes would then allow anyone to learn about a given topic in a limited way. \nThe best use case for this is to pass such a limited scope to an LLM Agent. They could then carry out a task with a hopefully small enough context to limit token usage, improve their speed and comprehension.\nAgentic tools that would help with this need to be taken into consideration.\n\nA few examples of questions that could be answered by these areas of knowledge:\n# CODE:\n- I want to add a new service to project X, what's the standard that other such services follow that I should adhere to?\n- I am making a new special View, what's the recommended style?\n- I need feature Y, does something similar already exist or should I create it from scratch?\n\n# INVESTMENT:\n- I want to invest in XRP, how is it performing against the other top cryptocurrencies?\n- I want sell some cryptocurrencies and enter the commodities market, how are the top commodities faring compared to the cryptocurrencies?\n\n#PURCHASES\n- I want to buy a new pair of sneakers, what's the latest opinion on the maker company?\n- I want to buy a house in London, what are the sought after properties arround Notting Hill ?\n\n### Another note - Blueprints:\nIt would be ideal to have tools that would give snippets of information about specific parts of a coding project. If an agent wanted to help and wanted to find out how the structure of the project is, what are the guidelines, conventions etc- it should be possible to do this. If there are some very strong opinions or major architectural decisions - it must be possible to gather these. For any project - it must be possible to create blueprints - the standards that certain pieces of knowledge will follow. For a coding project it's as explained (a code structure or how certain things tie together), for a knowledge graph about purchasing houses or apartments - it might be what data must be present for each, for investment - it might be what information each asset should have and how the timeseries for each is.\n\n# TESTS\nAs an easy way to see if the whole system is working, we want to have a test setup for at least 3 different knowledge graph scenarios:\na coding project, investment, purchasing property.\nWe want to have a way to see that for each scenario, if the user wants to gather meaningful information (for that area) they will receive information that makes sense from that knowledge graph.\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Create Test Scenario for a Property Purchasing Knowledge Graph (ID: 346cff1b-a052-422f-9e9c-e2bb8a694f92)\n##DESCRIPTION: Develop a test suite under `tests/scenarios/test_property_purchase.py`. This test will establish a 'Property' Area, define a Blueprint for what constitutes a property listing, ingest sample data for properties in a specific location, and confirm that the system can retrieve relevant, structured information based on user-like queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output.

This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout. Update this file whenever you introduce new major directories or restructure the project.\\n\\nTop-level\\n- pyproject.toml: Poetry configuration and dependency management using PEP 621 metadata.\\n- README.md: Project overview and basic usage instructions.\\n- .gitignore: Standard Python and tooling ignores.\\n- docs/: Documentation artifacts for contributors and maintainers.\\n- src/: Source code using the src/ layout.\\n- Dockerfile: Container image definition for running the FastAPI app.\\n- docker-compose.yml: Compose configuration to build and run the API locally with a single command.\\n\\nDocs\\n- docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md: You are here. Describes the structure and conventions.\\n\\nSource\\n- src/: Python package for the application code.\\n  - __init__.py: Marks the directory as a package.\\n  - config.py: Centralized application configuration using environment variables via Pydantic Settings.\\n  - graph_service.py: Service module that initializes and provides access to a knowledge graph instance. Centralizes graph-related logic and configuration. Provides CRUD methods for 'Areas of Knowledge' stored as Entity nodes with label 'Area'. Includes association methods to link Entities to Areas via BELONGS_TO, a scoped query method query_in_area(area_name, q), Blueprint CRUD and Area association, and a FastAPI dependency provider get_graph_service.\\n  - main.py: FastAPI application with basic endpoints (e.g., /health) and routers. Includes /areas router for managing Areas of Knowledge and their entity associations and scoped queries, plus the /blueprints router for managing Blueprints.\\n  - agent_tools.py: High-level functional interface for LLM agents to interact with the API (areas and blueprints). Wraps HTTP calls and provides convenience helpers.\\n  - models/: Pydantic domain models used by the service layer.\\n    - area.py: Area of Knowledge model and helpers for mapping.\\n    - entity.py: EntitySummary and EdgeSummary models for lightweight representation of nodes and edges.\\n    - area_link.py: EntityLinkRequest model used by POST /areas/{area_name}/entities.\\n    - query.py: QueryRequest/QueryResponse models and filters used by POST /areas/{area_name}/query.\\n    - blueprint.py: Blueprint, BlueprintCreate, BlueprintUpdate, BlueprintLinkRequest models for managing and linking blueprints.\\n  - routers/: FastAPI routers grouped by domain.\\n    - areas.py: CRUD endpoints at /areas for managing Areas of Knowledge, linking Entities, listing, and POST /areas/{area_name}/query. Also includes POST/GET /areas/{area_name}/blueprints for Area-Blueprint associations.\\n    - blueprints.py: CRUD endpoints at /blueprints for creating, reading, updating, deleting, and listing blueprints.\\n\\nTests\\n- tests/: Pytest test suite.\\n  - scenarios/: End-to-end scenario tests for different knowledge domains.\\n    - test_coding_project.py: Creates a coding project area, defines blueprints, ingests sample codebase entities, and validates scoped queries and blueprint retrieval.\\n    - test_investment.py: Creates an investment area with crypto and commodities sub-areas, ingests sample assets, and validates area-scoped queries and comparative insights.\\n\\nConventions\\n- Use the src/ layout. Configure Poetry to include packages from src via pyproject.toml.\\n- Keep generated files, caches, and environments out of version control (see .gitignore).\\n- Add new top-level directories only when necessary; document them here with their purpose.\\n\\nPlanned structure (to be implemented in future features)\\n- Integration with Graphiti library for advanced knowledge graph storage and querying.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",
