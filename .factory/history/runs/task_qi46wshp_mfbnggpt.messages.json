        "content": "# Speccer Agent Task Execution\n\nYou are the Speccer Agent. Your single responsibility is to analyze a user-provided task description and break it down into a series of atomic, implementable features. Your goal is to produce a complete and logical plan for the Developer agents to follow. You should try to tailor the feature titles and descriptions to be the best for LLMs to follow.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze**: Carefully read the task's title and description to fully understand the goal. Consider the project's existing structure and conventions.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Investigate**: Use the `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations to understand the project further.\n4.  **Create Features**: Formulate a list of consecutive, atomic features required to accomplish the task. Each feature should be a small, logical, and testable unit of work. Use the `create_feature` tool for each one you identify.\n3.  **Finish**: Once the features are created, you **MUST** call the `finish_spec` tool to complete your assignment.\n4.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_task` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 9b6fcd9f-86b9-4a95-bf03-e3cf51431be4)\n##TITLE:\nMonitor a task/feature as it's running and update information based off of git commits\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThe status of the tasks isn't updated\nWhen the Agent runs it updates the status in its own local copy.\nThis project's tasks/features statuses should update too.\nAs a later part, we also want to be observing git commits - if there's a commit in the appropriate branch (named after the task) with a given featureId specified, it should be possible to see the task.json inside there and update info HERE in this project based off it.\nAs a further improvement - we can make a 1-click merge solution so that the commit tied to the feature will get merged with the current code base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- create_feature(title: str, description: str) - Define and add a new, atomic feature to the task. Include a concise title and a clear description.\n- finish_spec() - Signal that the feature specification is complete for the current task.\n- block_task() - Stop work on the task and report why you are blocked at the task level.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - live-data/: Main process live data service and types for live data services.\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n    - hooks/useShortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts provider; respects user-selected modifier and avoids interfering with text input.\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer (exposes live data API).\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now.",

I have broken this down into five distinct, sequential features. The first feature addresses the real-time status updates. The next two features cover the git monitoring and data extraction process. The final two features implement the one-click merge functionality, separating the UI and backend logic. This plan provides a clear and logical path for the developer agents to follow. I will now create each feature using the `create_feature` tool and then call `finish_spec`.\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"tool_name\":\"create_feature\",\"arguments\":{\"title\":\"Implement Real-time Status Updates from Agent to Main Application\",\"description\":\"Currently, the agent updates its task and feature status in its own local context, but this information is not reflected in the main application. This feature involves establishing a communication channel between the agent execution environment (in `packages/factory-ts`) and the main Electron process. The agent should emit events for status changes (e.g., 'feature:start', 'feature:complete', 'feature:error'). The main process will need a listener to receive these events and update the application's live data store. Investigate `packages/factory-ts` to find the agent execution loop and inject an event emitter or callback mechanism. In the main process, the code that spawns the agent should register a handler for these events.\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"create_feature\",\"arguments\":{\"title\":\"Develop a Git Polling Service to Monitor Task Branches for Commits\",\"description\":\"To keep task and feature information synchronized with the agent's work, a new service is needed to monitor the agent's Git repository. This service, running in the Electron main process, will periodically poll the repository. It should specifically look for new commits on branches that follow the pattern `task/<task-id>`. The service needs to be robust and handle cases where the repository is not available. It should identify commits that have been pushed since the last check.\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"create_feature\",\"arguments\":{\"title\":\"Extract Feature Status from Commits and Update Application State\",\"description\":\"Building on the Git Polling Service, this feature adds the logic to process newly found commits. For each new commit on a task branch, the service must: 1. Parse the commit message to find a feature ID (e.g., by looking for a 'Feature-ID: <uuid>' trailer). 2. If a feature ID is found, check out the commit's content. 3. Read the `task.json` file from that commit. 4. Use the data from `task.json` (e.g., feature status, files worked on) to update the corresponding task and feature in the main application's data store. This will synchronize the state of the feature with the work committed by the agent.\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"create_feature\",\"arguments\":{\"title\":\"Add Merge UI for Features with Associated Commits\",\"description\":\"In the renderer UI, for any feature that has an associated commit detected by the Git Polling Service, a 'Merge' button should be displayed. This button will allow the user to merge the agent's work for that feature into the main branch of the target repository. The button should only be enabled for features that have a valid, mergeable commit available. You will need to modify the relevant React components to display this button conditionally based on feature data.\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"create_feature\",\"arguments\":{\"title\":\"Implement Backend for One-Click Feature Merging\",\"description\":\"This feature implements the backend logic for the 'Merge' button. An IPC channel should be created for the renderer to request a merge. The handler in the main process will receive the task ID, feature ID, and commit SHA. It will then execute the necessary Git commands to merge the task branch (or the specific commit) into the main branch of the agent's working repository. The implementation must include error handling for potential merge conflicts and provide feedback to the UI on the success or failure of the merge operation.\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"finish_spec\",\"arguments\":{}}]}",
