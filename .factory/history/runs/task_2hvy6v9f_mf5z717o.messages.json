    "content": "# Speccer Agent Task Execution\n\nYou are the Speccer Agent. Your single responsibility is to analyze a user-provided task description and break it down into a series of atomic, implementable features. Your goal is to produce a complete and logical plan for the Developer agents to follow. You should try to tailor the feature titles and descriptions to be the best for LLMs to follow.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze**: Carefully read the task's title and description to fully understand the goal. Consider the project's existing structure and conventions.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Investigate**: Use the `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations to understand the project further.\n4.  **Create Features**: Formulate a list of consecutive, atomic features required to accomplish the task. Each feature should be a small, logical, and testable unit of work. Use the `create_feature` tool for each one you identify.\n3.  **Finish**: Once the features are created, you **MUST** call the `finish_spec` tool to complete your assignment.\n4.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_task` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: 914e8f32-f97d-4645-a50d-7fc5c70417a3)\n##TITLE:\nChat needs to have better context about this project\n##DESCRIPTION:\nCurrently if we wish to send messages via the chat functionality they don't know about the project or the whole setup. The prompt for the chat needs to be better and if there are any extra tools that could make the functionality better they should be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TOOL SIGNATURES:\n- read_files(paths: list[str]) -> list[str] - Read the content of one or more files at the given relative paths. Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- create_feature(title: str, description: str) - Define and add a new, atomic feature to the task. Include a concise title and a clear description.\n- finish_spec() - Signal that the feature specification is complete for the current task.\n- block_task() - Stop work on the task and report why you are blocked at the task level.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"A string explaining your reasoning, analysis, and plan for this step. For example: 'I need to create the main application file and then add the basic boilerplate.'\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name_of_the_tool_to_call\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n        \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n{\n\"name\":\"tool_name\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"# File Organisation\\n\\nPurpose\\n- Provide a high-level map of the repository so contributors and agents can quickly find the right area.\\n- This is not a change log and not a per-file inventory.\\n\\nEditing Rules (read before updating)\\n- Only document major directories and subsystems. Do not list individual files.\\n- Keep bullets short (one sentence) and avoid \\\"New:\\\" or historical notes.\\n- When adding/removing a major directory or moving a subsystem, update a single bullet here.\\n- Prefer linking or pointing to deeper docs (README/OVERVIEW) rather than describing internals here.\\n- Never document build related artifacts.\\n\\nTop-Level Layout\\n- docs/: Project-wide documentation and specs; single source of truth for protocols and workflows.\\n- src/: Application source (Electron app: main, preload, renderer, and tooling).\\n  - renderer/: React UI (components, screens, hooks, services, navigation, preview runtime).\\n    - components/agents/: Agent-specific UI (status chips, run bullets, model selectors, project/cost/token chips).\\n    - services/: Renderer-side services (e.g., pricingService for LLM price lookup via IPC).\\n  - tools/: Developer and agent tooling (preview analyzer, factory integration, helpers).\\n  - main.js: Electron main process entry.\\n  - preload.js: Safe IPC surface exposed to the renderer.\\n- packages/: Local monorepo packages.\\n  - factory-ts/: Agent orchestration library (orchestrator, pricing, history, completion, git integration).\\n- scripts/: Project automation scripts and CLIs.\\n- Root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind/postcss configs, vite configs, forge config, .env.\\n\\nWhere to Learn More\\n- Agents and roles: packages/factory-ts/docs (AGENT_*.md).\\n- Factory TS overview and APIs: packages/factory-ts (see README/OVERVIEW files in that package).\\n- Preview system: see src/renderer/preview and related docs in docs/ (preview usage and analyzer).\\n- IPC and factory integration: src/tools/factory (renderer bridge and main process handlers).\\n\\nConventions (brief)\\n- Keep cross-cutting documentation in docs/; place domain-specific or area-specific READMEs next to the code they describe.\\n- Use descriptive directory names and keep responsibilities separated by area (renderer vs main vs tools vs packages).\\n\\nEnvironment & Credentials\\n- .env at the repo root is used for local development (e.g., credentials consumed by tooling and factory-ts).\\n\\nNotes\\n- If you are unsure whether something belongs here, it probably belongs in a local README under its directory, with this file providing only a one-line pointer to that area.\\n\"}\n\nBegin now."

The current system prompt in `src/chat/manager.js` is static and generic. The `chatTools.ts` already provides some project-specific tools (list/read files, list/get tasks), but the LLM isn't inherently aware of the *current* project's overall context without explicitly using these tools.\\n\\nTo address the request for \\\"better context about this project,\\\" I plan the following features:\\n\\n1.  **Improve Dynamic System Prompt Generation**: The current system prompt is a hardcoded string. I need to modify `ChatsManager` to construct a dynamic system prompt that includes essential project details, such as the project's name and description, and potentially an overview of the current task if one is active. This will provide immediate high-level context to the LLM without requiring it to use tools for basic orientation.\\n\\n2.  **Add `get_project_summary` Chat Tool**: While the system prompt provides initial context, the LLM might need more specific or detailed project information during a conversation. A new chat tool, `get_project_summary`, would allow the LLM to query for things like the project's full description, configuration details, or other high-level attributes it might need.\\n\\n3.  **Add `search_project_files` Chat Tool**: The current `list_files` tool only provides file names. To give the chat better context about the project's content, a `search_project_files` tool would allow the LLM to search for files based on their content, which is crucial for understanding project specifics without reading every file. This would be similar to the `search_files` tool available to agents.\\n\\nI'll start with the first feature to make the system prompt dynamic.\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"create_feature\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"title\": \"Implement Dynamic System Prompt for Chat\",\n        \"description\": \"Modify `src/chat/manager.js` to dynamically generate the system prompt for chat completions.
