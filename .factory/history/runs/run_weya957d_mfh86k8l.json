Your goal is to complete it by following these steps precisely.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: Read the feature's title, description and rejection (if provided) to understand its goal.\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: Use the provided `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md` to understand the project context.\n3.  **Implement**: Write or modify files to meet the feature's acceptance criteria. Use the `write_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`, `list_files` and `search_files` tools for all file operations.\n4.  **Complete the Feature**: When the feature is complete, you **MUST** call the `finish_feature` tool. This is your final step for a successful implementation.\n5.  **Handle Blockers**: If you cannot proceed, you **MUST** use `block_feature` to explain the reason for being stuck - this signals that you are blocked and ready for a new assignment.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor context on the overall project structure, including how tasks and features are organized, refer to `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. You should always update this file with new major directory changes.\n#CURRENT TASK (ID: f72dbcdb-77e7-4d00-bf72-e2cc59271644)\n##TITLE:\nMain project structure based on the graphiti library\n##DESCRIPTION:\nThere's a library `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti` that provides an upgraded RAG database - a knowledge graph. This project needs to be able to run locally and must expose an API that any client can interact with.\nFor reference, the whole library has been added under `graphiti/` .\n\n\n#ASSIGNED FEATURE: Cannot run - an error shows (ID: d51459dc-1d67-43a6-9f73-95eb786cabc9)\n##DESCRIPTION: poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload\n\nINFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['thefactory-knowledge']\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nINFO:     Started reloader process [22130] using WatchFiles\nINFO:     Started server process [22135]\nINFO:     Waiting for application startup.\nERROR:    Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/routing.py\", line 693, in lifespan\n    async with self.lifespan_context(app) as maybe_state:\n               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/routing.py\", line 569, in __aenter__\n    await self._router.startup()\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/starlette/routing.py\", line 670, in startup\n    await handler()\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/src/main.py\", line 20, in on_startup\n    configure_logging()\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/src/config.py\", line 58, in configure_logging\n    settings = get_settings()\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/src/config.py\", line 50, in get_settings\n    return Settings()  # type: ignore[call-arg]\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic_settings/main.py\", line 188, in __init__\n    super().__init__(\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^\n        **__pydantic_self__._settings_build_values(\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    ...<27 lines>...\n        )\n        ^\n    )\n    ^\n  File \"thefactory-knowledge/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pydantic/main.py\", line 253, in __init__\n    validated_self = self.__pydantic_validator__.validate_python(data, self_instance=self)\npydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 3 validation errors for Settings\nneo4j_uri\n  Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, input_value='bolt://localhost:7687', input_type=str]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/extra_forbidden\nneo4j_user\n  Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, input_value='neo4j', input_type=str]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/extra_forbidden\nneo4j_password\n  Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, input_value='your_secure_password', input_type=str]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/extra_forbidden\n\nERROR:    Application startup failed.

Returns an array of strings (one per file).\n- search_files(query: str, path: str = '.') -> list[str] - Search for files by name or textual content under the given path. Returns matching relative paths. The query input must be a space separated list of keywords\n- block_feature(reason: str) - Stop work on the current feature and report why you are blocked (e.g., missing context, unclear requirements).\n- finish_feature() - Mark the current feature as complete and end the run. Use only when the work fully meets the acceptance criteria.\n- list_files(path: str) - List files and directories at a relative path from the project root.\n- write_file(filename: str, content: str) - Create or overwrite a file with the given content. Always use this to write code or docs.\n- rename_file(filename: str, new_filename: str) - Rename or move a file from one path to another.\n- delete_file(filename: str) - Delete a file. Use with caution and only when necessary.\n- run_test() -> str - Run the test for the current feature and return the output. Use to verify implementation.\n\n#RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou **MUST** respond in a single, valid JSON object. This object must adhere to the following structure:\n```json\n[object Object]\n```\nThe thoughts field is for your reasoning, and tool_calls is a list of actions to execute.\nYour response will be parsed as JSON. Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.\nAs responses to the tool calls you will send, you will also receive JSON objects in the form:\n```json\n[{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameA\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}...{\n\"name\":\"tool_nameZ\",\n\"result\":\"...\"\n}]\n```\n\n#CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED:\n{\"docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md\":\"Project File Organisation\\n\\nThis document outlines the repository layout.

Use Docker Compose\\\\nThe provided docker-compose.yml defines the API service but does not inject your environment variables by default. Create an override file to pass them through.\\\\n\\\\n1) Create docker-compose.override.yml with your env:\\\\n   services:\\\\n     api:\\\\n       environment:\\\\n         - NEO4J_URI=${NEO4J_URI}\\\\n         - NEO4J_USER=${NEO4J_USER}\\\\n         - NEO4J_PASSWORD=${NEO4J_PASSWORD}\\\\n         - API_HOST=${API_HOST:-0.0.0.0}\\\\n         - API_PORT=${API_PORT:-8000}\\\\n         - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}\\\\n\\\\n2) Create a .env file at repo root with values:\\\\n   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687\\\\n   NEO4J_USER=neo4j\\\\n   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_secure_password\\\\n\\\\n3) Start the service\\\\n   docker compose up --build\\\\n\\\\n4) Visit docs\\\\n   http://localhost:8000/docs\\\\n\\\\nComplete Setup Verification\\\\n\\\\nTo ensure everything is working correctly:\\\\n\\\\n1) Test the health endpoint:\\\\n   curl http://localhost:8000/health\\\\n   Expected: {\\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"ok\\\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n2) Test document ingestion:\\\\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \\\\\\\\\\\\n     -H \\\\\\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\n     -d '{\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Neo4j is a graph database that stores data as nodes and relationships.\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"metadata\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Neo4j Intro\\\\\\\"}}'\\\\n   \\\\n   Expected: {\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\": true, \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"episode_uuid\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\", ...}}\\\\n\\\\n3) Test querying:\\\\n   curl -G http://localhost:8000/query --data-urlencode \\\\\\\"q=what is Neo4j\\\\\\\"\\\\n   \\\\n   Expected: {\\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"what is Neo4j\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"results\\\\\\\": [...]}\\\\n\\\\nIf all tests pass, your API is successfully connected to Neo4j and ready to serve clients!\\\\n\\\\nConfiguration\\\\nEnvironment variables (authoritative names are in src/config.py):\\\\n- API_HOST: Host interface for the API (default: 0.0.0.0)\\\\n- API_PORT: Port for the API (default: 8000)\\\\n- LOG_LEVEL: Logging level (default: INFO)\\\\n\\\\n- NEO4J_URI: Required. Example: bolt://localhost:7687\\\\n- NEO4J_USER: Required. Example: neo4j\\\\n- NEO4J_PASSWORD: Required. Example: your_password\\\\n\\\\nOptional Graphiti-related settings (may be used in future features):\\\\n- GRAPHITI_STORAGE_PATH: Default ./data/graphiti\\\\n- GRAPHITI_RESET: Reset underlying storage on startup (default: false)\\\\n- GRAPHITI_MODEL: Optional model name\\\\n- GRAPHITI_COLLECTION: Optional collection/namespace\\\\n\\\\nAPI Usage\\\\n- Health check\\\\n  Method: GET\\\\n  URL: /health\\\\n  Example:\\\\n    curl -s http://localhost:8000/health\\\\n  Response:\\\\n    {\\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"ok\\\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n- Ingest document\\\\n  Method: POST\\\\n  URL: /documents\\\\n  Body (JSON):\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Graphiti is a knowledge graph for RAG.\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"metadata\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Intro\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"docs\\\\\\\"}\\\\n    }\\\\n  Example:\\\\n    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \\\\\\\\\\\\n      -H \\\\\\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\n      -d '{\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Graphiti is a knowledge graph for RAG.\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"metadata\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Intro\\\\\\\"}}'\\\\n  Success response (201):\\\\n    {\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\": true, \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"episode_uuid\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"counts\\\\\\\": { ... }, \\\\\\\"raw\\\\\\\": { ... }}}\\\\n\\\\n- Query graph\\\\n  Method: GET\\\\n  URL: /query\\\\n  Params:\\\\n    - q: query string (required)\\\\n    - top_k: max results (default 5)\\\\n  Example:\\\\n    curl -G http://localhost:8000/query --data-urlencode \\\\\\\"q=what is graphiti\\\\\\\" --data-urlencode \\\\\\\"top_k=5\\\\\\\"\\\\n  Success response (200):\\\\n    {\\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"what is graphiti\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"results\\\\\\\": [ {\\\\\\\"uuid\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"fact\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\", ...}, ... ]}\\\\n\\\\nNotes\\\\n- The Graphiti API expects a working Neo4j connection. If connection variables are missing or incorrect, endpoints like /documents and /query will return 503/500 errors.\\\\n- Additional provider-specific settings (e.g., for embeddings or LLMs) may be required depending on how you extend Graphiti usage. Consult the Graphiti documentation if you integrate those features.\\\\n\\\\nDevelopment\\\\n- Code location: src/\\\\n  - main.py: FastAPI app and routes\\\\n  - graph_service.py: Graphiti integration (init, add document, search)\\\\n  - config.py: Settings and logging configuration\\\\n- Run locally (dev):\\\\n  poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload\\\\n- Formatting/linting: Add your preferred tools (e.g., ruff, black, isort) to pyproject.toml.\\\\n\\\\nTroubleshooting\\\\n\\\\nNeo4j Connection Issues:\\\\n- Connection refused to bolt://localhost:7687: \\\\n  * Check if Neo4j is running: `docker ps` (for Docker) or check Neo4j Desktop\\\\n  * Verify the port 7687 is not blocked by firewall\\\\n  * Ensure NEO4J_URI matches your Neo4j instance address\\\\n\\\\n- Authentication failed:\\\\n  * Verify NEO4J_USER and NEO4J_PASSWORD match your Neo4j credentials\\\\n  * For new Neo4j instances, the default user is 'neo4j'\\\\n  * Check if you need to change the initial password\\\\n\\\\n- Neo4j container won't start:\\\\n  * Check logs: `docker logs neo4j-graphiti`\\\\n  * Ensure ports 7474 and 7687 are not already in use\\\\n  * Try removing and recreating the container\\\\n\\\\nAPI Issues:\\\\n- 503 Service Unavailable when calling endpoints: Ensure NEO4J_URI/USER/PASSWORD are set correctly and Neo4j is reachable.\\\\n- 500 errors during ingestion/search: Increase verbosity with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG and check logs.\\\\n- Docker networking on Linux: If using docker run, host.docker.internal may not resolve; use the host IP or run Neo4j in a user-defined network with the API container.\\\\n\\\\nLicense\\\\nSee LICENSE in this repository.\\\\n\\\\nAcknowledgements\\\\n- Graphiti by Zep: https://github.com/getzep/graphiti\\\\n- FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\\\\n- Neo4j: https://neo4j.com/\\\\n\\\",\\\"docker-compose.yml\\\":\\\"version: \\\\\\\"3.9\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nservices:\\\\n  api:\\\\n    build: .\\\\n    image: local\\\\n    container_name: thefactory-knowledge\\\\n    ports:\\\\n      - \\\\\\\"8000:8000\\\\\\\"\\\\n    environment:\\\\n      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\\\\n    volumes:\\\\n      - ./src:/app/src:ro\\\\n    restart: unless-stopped\\\\n\\\",\\\"Dockerfile\\\":\\\"FROM python:3.11-slim\\\\n\\\\n# Prevents Python from writing .pyc files and ensures consistent output\\\\nENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\n    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\\\\n\\\\n# Install system dependencies\\\\nRUN apt-get update \\\\\\\\\\\\n    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential curl \\\\\\\\\\\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\\\\n\\\\n# Set working directory\\\\nWORKDIR /app\\\\n\\\\n# Copy dependency file first to leverage Docker layer caching\\\\nCOPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock* /app/\\\\n\\\\n# Install Poetry\\\\nENV POETRY_VERSION=1.8.3 \\\\\\\\\\\\n    POETRY_HOME=/opt/poetry \\\\\\\\\\\\n    POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\n    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE=false\\\\nRUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - \\\\\\\\\\\\n    && ln -s \\\\\\\"$POETRY_HOME/bin/poetry\\\\\\\" /usr/local/bin/poetry\\\\n\\\\n# Install dependencies\\\\nRUN poetry install --no-root --only main\\\\n\\\\n# Copy application source\\\\nCOPY src /app/src\\\\n\\\\n# Expose the port FastAPI/uvicorn will run on\\\\nEXPOSE 8000\\\\n\\\\n# Default command: run the FastAPI app with uvicorn\\\\nCMD [\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"-m\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"uvicorn\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"main:app\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"--host\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"0.0.0.0\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"--port\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"8000\\\\\\\"]\\\\n\\\"}\"}]",
