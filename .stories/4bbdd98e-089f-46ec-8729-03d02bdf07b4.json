  "description": "We need to make chat more user friendly and easy to use.\n- The main chat window should be of constant size and the messages should be horizontally scrollable and extend vertically as far as they need.\n- While waiting for a response there's a spinner showing the agent thinking.\n- We need to show how long the agent took to respond.\n- We get the full message content, but we want it to appear as if it was streamed in (written on the ago), create an appropriate animation\n- if the user is at the bottom of the chat window, then if there's a new message, only scroll a little bit so that the user can start reading and not chase the newly appearing text.\n- The message the user sends needs to appear instantly with a nice popping animation.\n- There needs to be a sound for sending a message and receiving a message.\n- The input needs to be reworked to be more like the FeatureForm, it should allow fast lookup of files and references to stories and features (when hitting @ for files and # for stories/features).\n- Whenever a file is references via @ in the text (whether the input box or in a message, it should be displayed with a nice chip. In the input box, if the caret is at the end of the chip and the user presses backspace - the view transforms into text, deletes the last character and goes back into showing file lookup. The equivalent thing should also happen for story/feature references.\n- if there's an error in the chat, show an appropriate error bubble\n- whenever the agent invokes tool calls, show it via a custom view that will allow inspection of the tool call (arguments and results and time taken)\n\nThe main Chat view component is:\nsrc/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx",

Original message: {\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"{\\\\\\\"thoughts\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"The user wants to refactor the `ChatView.tsx` component to have a constant height and ensure messages wrap correctly.\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: The goal is to modify `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx` to give the main chat window a constant height, remove responsive `vh` units, and ensure long messages wrap instead of causing horizontal scrolling.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: I have the contents of `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx` and `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. `ChatView.tsx` is the component I need to modify.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Plan Implementation**:\\\\n    *   **Constant Height**: The main container is a `<section>` element with `h-full` and `flex-1` classes. These make the component's height responsive to its parent container's size. To make the height constant, I will remove `h-full` and `flex-1`. The feature description explicitly forbids `vh` units. I will use a `rem` based height as it's not tied to the viewport dimensions but to the root font size, which is more of a user preference and generally constant. I'll choose `h-[60rem]` which translates to `960px` with a `16px` base font size, a reasonable fixed height for a chat application.\\\\n    *   **Message Wrapping**: I'll check the message container. It has `whitespace-pre-wrap` and `break-words` classes. These are correct for ensuring text wraps and does not overflow, so no changes are needed there.\\\\n    *   **Vertical Scrolling**: The message list `div` has `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-auto`. This setup correctly makes the list scrollable within its flexbox parent, provided the parent has a constrained height. My change to give the parent `<section>` a fixed height will ensure this works as expected.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Execute**: I will read `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx`, modify the `className` of the `<section>` element, and then write the file back.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"write_file\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import

Original message: {\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"{\\\\\\\"thoughts\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"The user wants to refactor the `ChatView.tsx` component to have a constant height and ensure messages wrap correctly.\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Analyze the Feature**: The goal is to modify `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx` to give the main chat window a constant height, remove responsive `vh` units, and ensure long messages wrap instead of causing horizontal scrolling.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Consult the File Structure**: I have the contents of `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx` and `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. `ChatView.tsx` is the component I need to modify.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Plan Implementation**:\\\\n    *   **Constant Height**: The main container is a `<section>` element with `h-full` and `flex-1` classes. These make the component's height responsive to its parent container's size. To make the height constant, I will remove `h-full` and `flex-1`. The feature description explicitly forbids `vh` units. I will use a `rem` based height as it's not tied to the viewport dimensions but to the root font size, which is more of a user preference and generally constant. I'll choose `h-[60rem]` which translates to `960px` with a `16px` base font size, a reasonable fixed height for a chat application.\\\\n    *   **Message Wrapping**: I'll check the message container. It has `whitespace-pre-wrap` and `break-words` classes. These are correct for ensuring text wraps and does not overflow, so no changes are needed there.\\\\n    *   **Vertical Scrolling**: The message list `div` has `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-auto`. This setup correctly makes the list scrollable within its flexbox parent, provided the parent has a constrained height. My change to give the parent `<section>` a fixed height will ensure this works as expected.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Execute**: I will read `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx`, modify the `className` of the `<section>` element, and then write the file back.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"write_file\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import

Original message: {\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"{\\\\\\\"thoughts\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"I have analyzed the feature request and the provided file `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx`. The goal is to change the auto-scrolling behavior in the chat view to prevent the user from 'chasing' streaming text. My plan is to implement a mechanism that auto-scrolls only when the user is already at the bottom of the chat. When a new message appears, instead of scrolling to the absolute bottom of the container, I will scroll to the top of the new message element. This will fix the scroll position while the message content streams in and grows, preventing the 'chasing' effect.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the steps I'll take:\\\\\\\\n1.  Introduce a `useRef` called `isAtBottomRef` to track whether the user's scroll position is at the bottom of the message list.\\\\\\\\n2.  Add a `useEffect` hook to attach a scroll event listener to the message list container. This listener will update `isAtBottomRef`.\\\\\\\\n3.  Replace the existing `useEffect` responsible for scrolling with a new one.\\\\\\\\n4.  The new `useEffect` will trigger on new messages or when the agent's thinking status changes.\\\\\\\\n5.  Inside this new effect, it will first check if `isAtBottomRef.current` is true. If it is, it will find the last message element in the chat and scroll to its `offsetTop` using `behavior: 'smooth'`. This ensures the top of the message is in view, and as it animates/streams, it will grow downwards without requiring further scrolling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI will now write the modified `ChatView.tsx` file.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"write_file\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import

I've replaced the old scrolling logic with a more sophisticated one that only scrolls when the user is at the bottom of the chat, and it scrolls to the top of the new message to prevent the 'chasing text' issue. I believe this fulfills the acceptance criteria for this feature. I will now mark the feature as complete.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"finish_feature\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\":{}}]}]}\\\"}\",\"stacktrace\":\"Error: Received no agentResponse. Original message: {\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"{\\\\\\\"thoughts\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"I have analyzed the feature request and the provided file `src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx`. The goal is to change the auto-scrolling behavior in the chat view to prevent the user from 'chasing' streaming text. My plan is to implement a mechanism that auto-scrolls only when the user is already at the bottom of the chat. When a new message appears, instead of scrolling to the absolute bottom of the container, I will scroll to the top of the new message element. This will fix the scroll position while the message content streams in and grows, preventing the 'chasing' effect.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the steps I'll take:\\\\\\\\n1.  Introduce a `useRef` called `isAtBottomRef` to track whether the user's scroll position is at the bottom of the message list.\\\\\\\\n2.  Add a `useEffect` hook to attach a scroll event listener to the message list container. This listener will update `isAtBottomRef`.\\\\\\\\n3.  Replace the existing `useEffect` responsible for scrolling with a new one.\\\\\\\\n4.  The new `useEffect` will trigger on new messages or when the agent's thinking status changes.\\\\\\\\n5.  Inside this new effect, it will first check if `isAtBottomRef.current` is true. If it is, it will find the last message element in the chat and scroll to its `offsetTop` using `behavior: 'smooth'`. This ensures the top of the message is in view, and as it animates/streams, it will grow downwards without requiring further scrolling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI will now write the modified `ChatView.tsx` file.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tool_calls\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"tool_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"write_file\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"arguments\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"src/renderer/screens/ChatView.tsx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import
