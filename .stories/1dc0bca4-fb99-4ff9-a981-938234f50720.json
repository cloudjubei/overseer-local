  "description": "For various testing purposes, we want to have a screen where a user can see all the tools that are available via the factory-tools (from the createTools) and where they can call them to try them out. All appropriate inputs must be presented.\nMake sure the UI/UX is clear and easy to navigate. The tools should be searchable and grouped by the files they come from (for instance all the StoryTools should be together).",
