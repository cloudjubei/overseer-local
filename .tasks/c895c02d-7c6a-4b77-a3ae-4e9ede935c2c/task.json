  "description": "A new project has been added to this one 'thefactory-db' . It allows storing documents and entities into a database and performing hybrid search on them (tokenized + embedding search). 'thefactory-tools' is already updated to use it - mainly for the 'search_files' tool that this projects 'FilesManager' uses.\n\nThis project needs to be the one that initiates the connection with 'thefactory-db'. It will then pass the appropriate connection info to 'thefactory-tools'.\nApart from integrating with both of the packages well - this project also needs to make sure that all the files within this project's repo are added to 'thefactory-db' and its \"documents\" table (there's a \"addDocument\" function exposed). Documents are text conten. For code files within this project, we should assign a \"project_code\" type to them. For any other project related file - \"project_file\", and for any external files in the future \"external_file\". \nOn app start - during the loading screen - each project needs to be checked to see if all the relevant documents are in the database - and if not, they need to be added. While the app is working and there are changes to the project's files - they should be appropriately updated.",
