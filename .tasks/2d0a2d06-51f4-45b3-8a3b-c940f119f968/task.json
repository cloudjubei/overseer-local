  "description": "Issue - a new package needs to be added, but the agents don't know about it (what it does and what the interfaces are). In fact even if there already is a package, its interfaces are not known and the purpose of the package isn't obvious. \nTherefore there must be a scheme, probably creating a file called PACKAGES.md - that will keep up to date information about what each package does and what are the most important interfaces.",
