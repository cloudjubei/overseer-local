  "description": "The electron app developed in `src/` needs extra features. References `README.md`, `docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md`. Implement a docs browser that lists Markdown files under docs/ (including docs/). Render Markdown with basic extensions (tables, code highlighting), safe HTML sanitization, and internal link navigation. Acceptance: Sidebar shows directory tree; renderer supports anchors and code blocks; clicking internal links navigates within the app; large files render efficiently; tested with provided docs/*.md.",
