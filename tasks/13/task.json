  "description": "Features should have editable dependencies. When creating or editing a feature it should be easy to browse and select other features as dependencies. If a feature has a dependency from a different task - the task should display these in the TaskDetails as well as in the Tasks list (similarly to how features have it in the TaskDetails).\n\nWhen hovering over a feature dependency bullet (in the TaskDetails) it should show a little summary card of that feature (as a callout) and when clicking on it it should take the user to the TaskDetails where that Feature is and highlight that Feature row.\nWhen hovering over a Task dependency it should behave analogously to the Features but for Tasks.\n\nIt's important to make reusable components for the Task dependency bullet and the Feature dependency bullet, as well as the summary callout cards.\nWhen talking in chat, it must be possible to reference a feature or task by starting to type '#' this should show a Task&Feature dependency selector. Whenever a a task or feature is referenced in the chat in such a way, the dependency bullets should be used with the standard behaviour described before.\n\nVery important - it must be possible to reference any task or feature in the whole project scope - as defined by the project's config.json under /projects.",
