  "description": "This is an Electron+React+Vite app. It would be ideal for an agent to immediately see the effect of their work by seeing a screenshot of how it renders in a given project. So after an agent changes some files via tools, they could request this new tool for screenshots of how the code/app that they just created renders. This can be based on this project. A methodology needs to be established - so components can be previewed this way. Perhaps each component requires special stubs and it's possible to tell ahead of time if such functionality is possible for that tool. When developing in XCode with SwiftUI it's possible to see previews such as these for even tiny components, and when using Android Studio - this is possible too. In XCode interaction is even possible within the component which would be the ideal example to emulate.",
