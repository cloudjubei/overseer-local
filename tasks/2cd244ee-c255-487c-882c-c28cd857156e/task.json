  "description": "Up until now everything was running locally, but we would like to introduce other clients to work together on a project. The common ground where all project data would be located is a git repository.\nSo there needs to be a backend that would allow for clients to do everything this app does (manipulate projects/tasks/features) and launch agents on them.\nThis means we also need to have a service for running agents as part of the backend (could be a micro-service that the main backend relays to).\n\nOne important requirement is that a client (like this one) might still want to run everything locally without touching the backend. It must still be possible to do so, which means that all project related data lives in the repository, apart from big blob data. Any indexing or extra storage of this blob data must be handled by the clients and backend as an additional feature - for instance searching files can be handled locally and externally via the backend employing exactly the same methods (i.e. SQL db with embedding search).\n\nWe need to spec out this task so that it contains all the features for the backend to work this way, and this app as the first client to integrate with it.\n\nWe will have to create a project and repository adjacent to this one. Not as a package, because the backend isn't a library. They might have shared code - in which case, we have to create yet another project for the shared library code.\nThe initial backend task will be in this project, and once it's running we will migrate to have a task for further features in its project and another task here for further improving this app's usage of it.",
