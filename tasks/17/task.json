  "description": "Up until now everything was running locally, but once we introduce other clients (mobile and web) we need to be able to have some centralised storage. There needs to be a good workflow for all clients to operate locally and sync with the backend (as much as possible should be achievable in offline mode). A very important consideration is how to integrate this with TheFactory project (given that that is a python project) or any other such project in the future.",
